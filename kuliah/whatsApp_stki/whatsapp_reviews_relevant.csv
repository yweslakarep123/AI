Willem van Heerden,"A couple of annoying bugs have crept in recently, and it's impossible to report these problems. This is unacceptable for such a widely used app. When certain contacts change their numbers, a new chat is started. The old chat indicates that the number has changed, so the app knows there's a connection between the numbers, but won't merge the chats. On the Pixel Watch 3 one can choose to not receive notifications while the phone is open. This works in every app except WhatsApp.",1
Oscar Q,"I was really hoping for a smooth messaging experience, but WhatsApp has been a letdown. The app frequently crashes and the notifications are inconsistent, which makes it frustrating to keep up with conversations. Plus, the user interface can feel cluttered at times. I also have concerns about privacy and data security. Overall, I expected more from such a popular app. Time to look for alternatives",1
Mike Moritz,"Updates always break functionality while adding ""features"" nobody asked for. Updated Feb2025. WA now opens a menu of file types when attaching something. Before you could just pick what you wanted. It doesn't display all my albums when sending pics. Long pressing the ""gallery"" file type opens my photo gallery but it's buggy and slower and doesn't display mp4 or all of my gifs like it did before. I now have to share my files from my gallery app to WA as a work-around. I dread their updates.",1
astroturtle,"FIX THE BUG THAT FORGETS YOUR LOGIN AND FORCES YOU TO RESTORE EVERYTHING. On every device, ""You have been logged out"" without ANY reason. And how is it possible to have WhatsApp set to ""daily"" backups, and then the most recent backup is from over a month ago? A month of messages, images, docs, videos, just gone because your app can't even do a BASIC BACKUP properly. Garbage app. The only reason I keep using this thing is because other people.",1
A Google user,"I noticed that recently after updates, when listening to voice notes, if it's a long voice note the voice note will stop when the screen goes off. Dunno why it's doing this. Before it wasn't like that. Also noticed that missed calls are not shown on screen, but only when you open WA and check you chats you will see the missed call label inside the chat. Please work on a feature that allows you to block Whatsapp video/ calls in general or for a scheduled time.",2
Alexius Emejom,"Very easy-to-use UI. I am not a fan of the latest updates to the Status updates interface that is displayed horizontally. I prefer the original vertical display for the status updates. I wish WhatsApp could revert to that view. Also, maybe the communities could be organized on another tab to free up space for status updates.",4
Imad Nassar,"Excellent app overall but I'd like to point out an option that should be improved . I noticed that when recording a voice message , the sound is not that clear and crisp compared to Facebook messenger . When I record a voice message on messenger , the sound is so clear unlike when it's on WhatsApp . Please improve voice messaging sound quality and thank you.",4
zahra,Love WhatsApp but there is a glitch that is very annoying. When I scroll ust a little bit up it jumps up hours earlier randomly. It happens very often and is confusing and annoying. Please look into this! Also please have a feature to disable or lock the video message feature because when scrolling it gets clicked on accident and is very annoying,2
hu trillz,"Just started using the app and I'd happily give 5 stars if it were solely based on the product's simplicity design, and operating abilities, however I'd like to make 2 (obvious) suggestions. 1. Being a translate feature and perhaps have in settings a setting to set your preferred translating language. Also, on the topic, many prominent websites are offering live video call translating capabilities, might be worth considering. 2. A more clear account/profile accessibility button/page/feature.",4
Denise Martinez,"Fix This Bug: Having issues with accessing the gallery on my phone. App has access, but my albums do not show up in the option to send photos. Can't see all my photo/video albums Currently, when I try to share a picture or video on WhatsApp directly, it doesn't let me see all my folders. Many other users are having the same issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times.",2
Sarah Estes,"I have been trying to get my account unlocked after it was (as admitted through the review) mistakenly marked as spam. Yet it has been over 24 hours and I can't even login. I was given no warning, suddenly a message just appeared saying I wasn't allowed access. I've tried multiple times to get in touch. The one time a call actually came it hung up before giving me the verification code. You made a mistake, you need to fix whatever is going on",1
Clif Jackson,Works great only don't think that is what's app or even your internet that's causing you're connection to be slow or be dropped... It's very much got too do with your actual phones intenna more than anything else I wanna say... So if it's been over 6 months since you've bought or upgraded... Then your gonna have issues.. Once again not the actual app or your internet provider but your phone that's a POS. Almost like they made them to do that before long??? App works great overall!!!!,4
Sean,"Jesus christ, app developers: stop changing things people use every day for no good reason. Don't move the button to attach photos from the gallery to the opposite side of the screen, so now I reflexively keep hitting ""attach location"" or whatever. Don't make it so the slider sometimes refuses to appear and I can't quickly scroll back through photos from a long time ago. It worked fine. Leave it alone.",1
Corey Hernandez (Parkorey),"Have been using app for years. It was fantastic initially, but lately the quality of the app has gone way down. Calls have been dropping more and more frequently. Video quality has become very pixelated. App has been glitching and saying I decline peoples calls when I never declined them, most times phone won't even ring and I'll have half a dozen missed calls all arrive at once. Shame, was a great app for a while. Hopefully they can fix all these glitches, but it's been like this for months.",2
Dino Bettini,"They removed the ""show notifications"" option when muting a group. This is such a downgrade. Also, the limits to sharing and forwarding messages are horrible. Edit: Also, similar to Instagram, their features are so full of bugs that it seems only interns work on them. Restoring the chat history on another phone always fails after getting to 97%. Lost an entire day trying it.",2
Ruben Sanchez Gonzalez,"Since meta bought this app, it has been declining both in quality and functionality. Vocie messages. If you leave a draft, a lot of times you'll lose your message. If you pause while recording a voice note, it stops preventing the screen from turning off, so it interrupts your message. Is there are 2 or more voice notes to be played, you can't just play one, leave the app to do something else, and keep auto play the rest. It just stops. All in all, quality worsening each day.",2
Yoel Teitelbaum,"This is the worst app when it comes to switching devices. There is no one to talk to except an AI that keeps repeating the same useless response over and over. It's a shame that, in this day and age, the process is so complicated, takes so long, and still ends up failing. It's time for real investors to take over and fix it."" my advice if you need this for business don't touch it use some alternative messaging services there are plenty out there",1
Tanaka Magos,"""Amazing! WhatsApp has revolutionized the way I communicate with friends, family, and colleagues. Its seamless and intuitive interface makes it effortless to send messages, share media, and make voice and video calls. The end-to-end encryption ensures my conversations remain private and secure. With its cross-platform compatibility, I can stay connected across devices. WhatsApp's constant innovation, such as its disappearing messages and group chat features, keeps",5
Sandy bind,"For what I use it for at work, the app works fine. But when I had a problem with my number being banned after I tried to move it to a new phone, I got no response from Whatsapp. So gave up and adjusted at work. But on a whim I tried to download the app again after a month and a half...and it downloaded and works just fine. So...the app is fine as long as you don't have a problem! And just maybe, if you give it time, your account will reset.",3
Nick Noyce,"the perfect replacement for SMS! The only annoying thing is the lack of any kind of housekeeping function, I'd like an option to be able to clear down old chats to keep most recent chats, to do this manually would take ages, my backup size is large because of this but I don't want to clear whole entire chats as I like to have at least the last few months to refer back to.",4
Lucius I.,"Beware! Please read! I recently noticed pictures that I did not download on my phone- lots. I thought that maybe I had synced my account with my daughter's. Nope. So I researched it. Turns out apps can download stuff onto your phone. WhatsApp has been not only downloading pictures to my phone but accessing my contacts, my music and audio, and my phone calls in the last 24 hours. I have to use this app for school or I would delete it but I have revoked all permissions.",1
Damilola Akinwumi-Oke,"Your updates are too much too unnecessary sometimes and you only focus on updating the phone version. What happened to the laptop WhatsApp version? That hasn't been updated in a while. There are no ""Favorites"" section on there. Or even lists. Do better. Also, would it be too worrisome to y'all to increase the number of chats that can be pinned??? 3 is just too 2019. Update that. Very necessary.",3
kevin whisenant,"Unfortunately, I can't send msgs from my watch. I receive them fine but when I reply, they're stuck pending with the clock icon. They'll only send if I force close the app and open it up again. But lately that hasn't been working either. Loading voice msgs often times gets stuck spinning and never loads. I have the LTE version and everything else works fine. No issues on my phone. This happens whether I'm on WiFi or LTE. I've tried uninstalling, restarting, force closing. Nothing fixes it.",1
Mwape Chimpampa,"I really like the app. It makes things so easy. But I still have some suggestions, not really complaints. I really think that it would be good for a feature to be added for people to copy the text on their status post, so that if they typed anything wrong, they can copy, delete, paste and make the minor edits needed instead of typing everything all over again. And if another feature to allow one to change to view once anything they forgot to send as a view once by a simple tap, that would be 👍",4
Roman Abreu,"There's a very annoying voice messaging bug that has been going on for months where for some reason the volume is so low that even at max volume you can barely hear them. Initially I thought it was my current phone but recently I've received voice notes from iPhone users with the exact same issue, and it's not only annoying but dangerous as sometimes one can forget to lower the volume before playing something else. Please fix it!!",1
Lavendeer 201,"Custom stickers are a pain, gifs need to continue playing, and the latest update is awful for photos! I used to be able to see all my albums, but now I can only select from Downloads, Camera, Screenshots, and other preselected albums. This makes it VERY DIFFICULT to find the things I want to send to friends and family. Additionally, the typing and correcting spelling is very glitchy/frustrating now. Besides that, it's great for communication without cell service, and is much better than SMS!",3
Lantis XT,"I do love this app, but there are two glaring issues. I communicate with my partner overseas using this app, but the send button for video messages is directly next to the ""1"" button, and it's extremely easy to accidentally hit the ""1"" button. Very frustrating! The second issue is the autoplay. I'll listen to a voice memo ans try to respond, and it'll autoplay the next message, playing over what I'm trying to record. There really needs to be a setting to turn off autoplay. Other than that, 👍!",2
Bobbie Cole,"Finally found the hidden list bar at the top. I found that I had to swipe down in order to see it. Why is it hidden in the first place? It should be shown as default! ... *App could use ""scheduled messages"" to send a text later in the day. ... Also could use the ability to pin more (up to 8) conversations to the top. ... *Ability to have photo albums shown in alphabetical order would be best for faster searching for photos to attach to conversations.",2
Henry Ofori,"WhatsApp Messenger is good 👍🏼 for communication from all locations. It helps to forward images, files, documents, and other links to help reach more people and set plans for your support. The main difficulty it shows when making a call is: ""connecting/reconnecting"", which I think is from the network. When this statement shows no voices are heard 😒, either you called or you're receiving a call from others. It's great 👍🏼 in sharing current status and chatting with families and friends 🧡.",4
Reinan Mortiz,"The chat is good, but for video calls the volume control is frustrating since it does not allow for precise settings. The lowest call volume setting is still loud enough for everyone around to hear. The app also does not allow for listening to music through Spotify or multitasking like that while on a video call, which is also something I hope could be updated in the near future.",3
Clara Cherif,"as much as it is the app I use most, there are a few annoying glitches I get. for instance, I still didn't get the meta AI. all the ppl around me did and I didn't, even though I'm all caught up on updates. there's also this thing on the desktop wp where every open once message I send appears as if its sent by the recipient. I already texted WhatsApp support about it last week and sent screenshots. I'm waiting for the problems to be solved. other than these everything else is perfect.",4
Sebastian Fuller,"They just made the worst possible UI update. Before if I wanted to send a photo, it would just show ALL the albums in my gallery on the app to select and send. Now, it ONLY shows recents and my cloud stored albums. And there's no way to access or view my other albums not in the Google cloud, in the app. So I have to go to my gallery, find the photo, and then ""share"" it to the chat in whatsapp. Why they made this awful change? I have no idea. It worked perfectly fine.",3
Connor Mahoney,"It's a messenger app I primarily use for its voice message feature. The voice messages portion is a hot mess. Sometimes the app tries to route the audio to the headset speaker instead of the normal one. Sometimes it'll black out and lock the screen while playing, which forces you to restart the whole message. Sometimes your recording is interrupted by a text or app popup, requiring the whole recording to be redone as it drops the whole voice message entirely if you didn't finish it. Hot. Mess.",3
Connor Hawke,"Gone. WhatsApp suddenly lost all my messages. It wasn't even open. One day I opened the app and it said it would try to restore my chat history from backup. It failed. Many others have had the same issue; search Google. The fix to get some (but probably not all) of your data back is long-winded and may require rooting your phone. I'm no longer using WhatsApp. Also: critical bugs on Android, including missing messages/media in exports. Customer service is either AI or illiterate. Use another app.",1
Carl Kemp,"So why exactly is it that you STILL haven't mastered the arcane art of editing text messages on Android??? Everybody else seems to have it down pat. At least half a dozen times, I have tried to edit a message that I sent, only to have my edits disappear as soon as I confirm them! Seriously, why even offer an edit feature if you have no intention of actually implementing it???",2
RESJ Robinho,"Hello, though the app is perfect in all its features, it would be a nice thing to be able to highlight chats (highlighted chats appear on top, separated from other non-highlighted chats by a line). And also, the voice message feature will sometimes bug out and make the screen go black for a few seconds. The audio also lowers when this happens, difficultating the use of voice messages.",4
Perry Bdg,"""I've been using WhatsApp for years, and it's been my go-to messaging app. I love its simplicity and reliability. The voice call feature is particularly useful for staying in touch with friends and family abroad. However, I've noticed some occasional lag when sending files. Overall, WhatsApp is a solid choice for anyone looking for a hassle-free messaging experience?.""",5
Mubarik Hanif20,"WhatsApp is an amazing messaging app that keeps me connected with friends, family, and colleagues effortlessly. The interface is simple, user-friendly, and the voice/video calling features are clear and reliable. I love how it allows me to send messages, share media, and even make group chats without any hassle. The end-to-end encryption makes me feel secure, and the regular updates keep improving the overall experience.",4
Rafael Sarante,"The new system to share photos and videos is so tedious. I have a lot photos and videos on my phone organized by album so I can locate them easily and the new system implemented by WhatsApp takes a lot of time to get to the album option. First show the most recent and then we have to tap Recently for it give us some of the albums, but if it isn't the one you're looking for a wait is due so the See More option pops up and that takes so long and have to mention the extras steps now.",3
Antonymous User,"Great app if you have wifi and need to pop off a few text messages but if you use it to make a call, prepare to get frustrated and angry. You'll get about 30 seconds before either you can't hear them or they can't hear you. This ""feature"" is worthless and shouldn't be advertised. I don't want any ""get ahold of so and so to help solve the problem"" I just want it fixed",1
Thurman Yates,"The user interface is awesome. But, I can't use it for much because I can message only message people that are also on WhatsApp. So, 2 people out of all my contacts. No one else wants to use it for that exact reason. It would be so great if it could be used as the default sms/text app for my phone and I could send and receive messages from anyone whether they had WhatsApp or not.",1
Jessica Clark,I used to use this app almost exclusively for messaging however after the latest update it has become intensely frustrating to use and is very glitchy. Voice to text is almost useless now and trying to edit a dictated message isn't possible. It simply highlights 1 word and does not allow anything to be done after that until it closes out the message and makes you start completely over. Hopefully they fix it eventually.,1
vintage rain,The new update changing things with the ui makee the app more difficult and annoying to use. The format and shape of things does not have to be changed. Today I saw the gallery option only accessing a very small number of my photos making it much more difficult to access and send specific images. I hope the ui goes back to the previous one because it worked much better.,3
Ilovelosangeles,"The LAST SEEN is not working for the past week! It even shows the wrong date & time for myself. I've uninstalled/reinstalled. I looked for updates; I'm using the latest version. I restarted my phone several times. Also, my phone is new, Android 14. This app started this issue last week. Until then, there were no issues. Also, people are reading & replying to my messages, but my ""two gray checkmarks"" on my messages are not turning blue and yes, we all have ""read receipts"" turned on.",1
Michael Eiland,"Very unhappy. For some reason when choosing a picture to send in a message, of all my albums in my gallery, only 5 are visible to select from. This was never the case before up till now. I only can select pictures from camera folder, recents folder, downloads folder, whatsapp and screenshot folders. If I click the 3 buttons top right only cloud apps is there. This means if I have a picture in another folder I have to transfer it to one of these to be able to send it in whatsapp. Permission on",2
Max S,"New updates makes the screen sooooo congested. A search bar suggesting I ask if Mars has life: WHATS hAPPening?? It's a messaging app, what was wrong with that. This was once a great piece of tech that cost a few bucks a year. It's like having a crazy uncle or something just renovating stuff for no reason and the changes just get worst and more confusing. Update. Only getting worse. The text field is now so broken you can't move the cursor with out the app losing its mind. Adding photos is broke",1
Homayoun Yousefi'zadeh,"Chat customization introduced recently is great. But in the latest version, the green accent color in the chat list (used for buttons, highlights, and some UI elements) is not directly customizable through settings. Please add color customization to the chat list as well.",4
Petu Pullo,"The new updates are HORRIBLE. After the new updates, everything on the app ahs become so much more difficult to find. They moved around where for example attaching images happens, so I keep jumping to the contacts app. A new feature is the bubble that pops up instead of the ""is typing..."" On the top of the screen, and it is the one thing that I absolutely disliked about Messenger, so why do they need it here? It brings 0 extra value and is distracting. Very disappointing.",2
Sidra Siddique,"From my point of view, WhatsApp is a fantastic messaging app that makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family. I appreciate its simplicity and the ability to send messages, share photos, and make voice or video calls for free. The end-to-end encryption gives me peace of mind about privacy. However, I also see the downside of constant notifications and the pressure to respond quickly. Overall, I think WhatsApp is a great tool for communication, as long as it’s used mindfully.",2
Danish Syah,"Emoji button is gone from the text status option. Why is that this app's update always makes it worse than before. I get that you did make an improvement (unnoticeable as always), but the things that has been removed or changed not to the users liking always sticks out the most. And one more thing. The web version should at least make text status. People who works 24/7 on their PC might need to use that anyway. And now somehow my contact isn't linked to this app",2
Joy Rose,"The new update has made it a frustrating process to try to upload videos or pictures, even finding the albums has been made more difficult. The edit and autocorrect features for text are very buggy, as well as voice messages or even phone calls. Not to mention all the spam groups I get added to and the spam calls I get. It just seems to get worse over time when this could just be a simple messaging app.",1
Varun Setlur,"On my Pixel 9 pro running Android 15, calls get muted when switching apps or locking the screen. The other party cannot hear until I switch focus back to WhatsApp. This makes it nearly impossible to use my phone for multitasking during long calls. I've granted all permissions and disabled battery optimizations, but the problem persists. I do not have this issue making regular phone calls, which I'm doing more of now.",1
Dennis Mikhail,Why is it so difficult to fix this app? It should not stop playing voice messages whenever a shadow comes across the light sensor on the phone I don't understand why that's even a built-in feature there's absolutely no use for that. On top of the fact it likes to pause while you're recording and sometimes records and other times doesn't. Doesn't seem like very big issues to fix so please do so.,1
Henry Carm,"Pls, can you stop changing and removing file properties when i want to send a song by ""audio"". im forced to send it through ""documents"" And The Max Character limit for paste is too small when editing a media on Mobile, i wanted to paste all the lyrics under the media to reduce message count but no... i have to send them seperately which reminds me, when i forward a document upload (like .mp3) with its long captions, it only forwards the song, without the captions like, WHY",3
Joe DeBellis,"i have been concerned that when I lost my primary phone in the lake and started using this cheap give away tablet, someone or something installed a keypad and session mirroring app. very weird stuff has been happening. as I am typing there is. lag, sometimes letters are backspaced over making the word misspelled, and I now have to click twice on certain actions. Plus pictures and video of me, mostly from the front facing camera appear in my folders. when I check the meta data, like location,",1
Nils M,"The photos sent from this app keep saving on my gallery. It's a nuisance. I have to keep manually deleting them. To add to this nuisance, the app keeps asking about saving to Google drive or something else. Why not save in a temporary app folder like most apps do? Or at least make that an option... I literally loathe opening this app, and I loathe getting memes. I use the app cuz some family and friends overseas are on it, I wish they were on some of the other better communications apps.",2
Leanne Brereton,"Stop messing with this app. Changing things around every 5 minutes and every time you do it goes worse. Can't access my full SD Card now. Only recents, camera, screenshots and downloads are available. I want access to ALL my photos and folders not just the ones you recommend. Click on see more and it brings up the exact same folders so how is this ""more""? Also keeps crashing and booting me out half way through typing. Started doing it last few days since someone started messing around again.",1
Tyler Rose,"I was really liking this app to message one person. then suddenly this morning I stopped receiving notifications from them, until I open my phone and then the app itself. they were in fact messaging me but WhatsApp was not notifying me whatsoever. I've done everything I can but I'm still having the same issue. I prioritize them in every way, I turned off do not disturb mode, but it is simply not notify me until I open the app.",2
Ilari Welling,"Meta have managed to ruin the app in the latest updates. What was simple, like adding pictures, is now a complex annoyance as editing them and the text added to them has been made more difficult, and the functionality is simply annoying. They have tried to improve something that didn't even need improving, and in doing so, have made it so much worse. At least there are other apps to migrate to, I will suggest that if this is not rolled back.",1
Tori McDowell,"If I could give WhatsApp zero stars, I would. The app is full of issues that never get fixed. It crashes constantly, the notifications don’t work properly, and messages often don’t send or arrive late. The interface is clunky, and it’s impossible to find old chats easily. Group chats are a nightmare with endless spam, and you can't even mute certain contacts without them still showing up.",1
Dimitri Ajazi,"The app itself, as a chat client, at least seems to be fine. The service itself is terribly buggy. Via web, I was trying to upload an icon for a group of just two family members and my account suddenly got blocked. The icon wasn't offensive in any way. What gives? I can't even delete the account. But WA can sell my contact list, can't it now.",1
Eugene Chinemelum,"I was complaining about arranging people's status in the order of time of posting. Now, posting or sharing photos or videos on status or to contacts is now a war. I thought it was network challenge, but it's not it. This is really really challenging. How can 1 photo load for almost 2 minutes.. These are so bad... Other features are improving though..",1
Guess Who,"WhatsApp Is a Mess! Everyone I came in contact with suggested I get this app, so I downloaded it. I find it very complicated, difficult, and frustrating to use. Instructions aren't clear. It's not user friendly. I don't keep a contact list so I can't invite other users. I can't even invite users with my QR code because I can't copy it. This app has been a collosal waste of my time and I've gotten nowhere. Notify me when this app can at least make it easy for me to invite people to connect with.",1
Levi Zammit,"Please fix your Bluetooth issue for playback of audio messages. I cannot play audio messages unless I have some other music playing, in which case it speaks over the music which is annoying. If I pause the music the message appears to be playing and no sound comes out. This only happens when connected to a Bluetooth device IE car or headphones. I have a pixel 7 Pro with all recent/relevant updates to app and OS.",1
A Google user,I've been a staunch supporter of WhatsApp for many years but since one of the latest updates when I try to take a picture and zoom in to the max it automatically switches to that dreaded video note. I can't understand the point of it anyway. When I want to shoot a video I use the normal one. Why do I need that silly little circle but most to the point why does it switch to that when I'm just trying to take a closeup picture? Until you fix it I'm only giving you 2 stars 🙄,2
Scott Phillips,"Locked my account at a critical time. Do not trust this app. I signed up and started using this app to communicate with a travel provider while travelling internationally. I only sent messages to two travel providers, an airbnb host and a car rental I currently have a car from. Whatsapp locked my account due to spam for no reason. I can't communicate with the car rental company and desperately need to contact them to return the car before my flight.",1
Brenda Lew,"I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THE FORCED BLURRING WHEN I USE THE FRONT CAMERA. Yes, I double checked that backgrounds and filters were off. It still happens. This is a pain in the behind when I'm trying to show an object from the front as it blurs it out. and it makes the quality look trash. META, GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION TO TURN THIS FEATURE OFF.",1
Lupo32,"I've been using this app for years with no issues. Now I think since the last update my voice calls are not working properly. I can dial out but the person I dialed can't hear me at all. I've tried everything in settings and reinstalled the app, no change. Wish there was a fix for this. The Whatsapp support was useless.🙄",1
Lisa Tibbitts,I have enjoyed using this app but I want the option to delete anything I've shared for everyone whenever the need arises. I am using it to get to know possible romantic partners but after talking and sending videos and photos (nothing r rated) I don't want them having access once we stop talking. That seems reasonable to me. Even harmless photos and videos can be misused when things are complicated and end.,3
Deeksha Hota,"1. Issues with notifications and calls - they don't show up until the app is opened. There has been no notification about the calls at all for a long time. 2. The audio quality is terrible, to the point of just muffled noise. The background noise is too amplified. Please look into the matter :)",1
abdul shehu,"Not bad, but two issues, when viewing media on a chat, it combines all the media files whether sent or received, I feel it should be separated, also the status upload is terrible, it allows you write more than it can contain and when u upload it, you see half of what u have written is not there, also video trim for status is not good, u can trim 30seconds out of a 1 minute video and it will upload a different 30 secs from what u selected. Lastly you should select what u want as the app lock",3
Birdi Saab,"Everything is perfect except I can't receive whatsapp phone/video calls notifications on the screen straight away when the phone rings. I can feel the vibration, hear the sound. In order to see who is calling me on whatsapp, I must open the app first, then wait for it to pop up the calling pop-up then click on it to see who is calling and then I cam answer it. IPHONE doesn't have this issues but my Samsung S25 Ultra has this issue.",3
Courtney Krieger,"WhatsApp is not what I expected. 1. Limited Features: Despite being a leading app, it’s missing basic features like advanced customization for notifications or the ability to pin more than three chats. 2. Poor Media Management: Photos and videos automatically clog up storage unless manually disabled, and managing media within the app is tedious. 3. Privacy Concerns: While messages are encrypted, the app’s ties to Meta (Facebook) raise questions about how user data is handled.",1
Ward Martin,"Just did a phone upgrade. You can't restore backup if you forget password because; the recovery offered requires access to the program but,...

Peter Trimmer,"Android user - recent update now deletes text if you add an image to send after typing. If you add image first, text can be added after. Different to how it used to work. This has been asked about on a couple of forums I use. Android users affected, iPhone still works the original way. Admin, please fix. This is a frustrating update.",4
Dewie Vogelsanger,Whatever update they've made to the attachment option. Now I can't access all the folders on my phone it just has them all under recent or there's 4 folders but thats not all of them. Meta really making me want work to move to another platform. The AI search being added is unnecessary and not having the search button always available is stupid. Having to scroll all the way up is ridiculous.,1
Jasmine Green Tea,"I'll edit my rating once my issue has been resolved. Currently for my WhatsApp, all the emojis are missing. When I open up the emojis menu, it just says ""No emoji found. Try searching with different text"". But the thing is, I did not even type anything to search for a specific emoji. The whole menu is missing.. Now, my only way to type emojis are through my phone's keyboard.",1

Shramanth Rajarathnam,"For some reason now, the chat filters don't get automatically hidden when I exit and enter the app again. Also, going back from a group takes me to the main page instead of the community when there are other unramead groups in that community. Filter for non-contacts would be great.",4
Rod Ibi,"This app is the best to use for communication, really has done a lot for me, and it deserves five stars, though four will do, given the recent update I downloaded and it kinda is worse than the previous version,here I get to scroll back and select a text I want to reply to instead of continuing to reply to texts simultaneously without me going down to where the text I have sent is, unlike the previous one, where you remain at the point in the chat where you where before sending a text",4
Harlequins,The latest update which involves channels on Whatsapp is frustrating. It's a good idea but the way it's being arranged makes the interface not user friendly. I prefer the former version. I hardly find the status I want because of this so called channels thing update. Edit: The rearrangement makes sense now. I can access my contacts status and other features with ease currently. Thanks for the update.,5
KELVIN LAM,"Been Good. Since having mobile data, this is the default communication App. One suggestion to the developer, as we communicate with one another, making an appointment with a friend or a group is common. Many apps have integration with Calendar. Maybe WhatsApp can also have some kind of events/calendar function integration?",5
Alexis Veronica Neo Wen Ni,"This app is awesome, you can contact with people (obviously) not only you can scan QR codes to connect with your computer or laptop, though there are some problems. It's hard to scan the QR cause it doesn't scan nicely. Other than that, the updates r really slow. My friends alrdy have updated new feautures and i don't although i did update this app. Whatsapp, please fix this update issue",4
Jade Hassall,"It's great for typing but video and voice calls drop constantly. After about a minute, the call states ""reconnecting"" and then drops. You can't report it to WhatsApp either as they don't provide chat or email support for technical issues regarding calls. As for being able to send pictures - good luck. It barely allows you to find any pictures anymore! Since the update, things have been so much worse.",3
Jerica Cary,"Starting a few days ago I can no longer send any videos. They all turn green and glitch out, making them completely unviewable. I've cleared my cache, I've updated, I've uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing changed. This seemingly came out of nowhere? It's a massive inconvenience. I also can't change my chat background anymore, it just doesn't do anything after I press confirm.",2
Tanya Stepanic,"Please fix issue with calls not showing up on lock screen. For context, I have many years of experience working in mobility and have performed all possible troubleshooting steps. Additionally, I have 2 different make/model Android devices, both have the exact same settings for WhatsApp and notifications, but only 1 is showing full screen incoming calls. Will update to 5 stars once fixed. Thanks!",3
Charles Morris,"Love being able to download voice notes and listen during a hike without my phone. However, playback stops usually 5 mins in unless I switch focus to the app. Playback position is lost - wish there was a way to seek even if rough.

Dr Shahnaz Aslam Jamal,"Over the years, WhatsApp has greatly improved. Texting, sharing, audio video calling features are good. Word processing, formatting needs to be brought at par with other such apps. Editing of pictures has a great margin if improvement, as this is used by online teachers to mark& grade assignments. Tutorial videos for new features is a must. There are many good features in this app such as encrypted messages, it is confusing to use. It is good for chatting,",4
Madhumanti Nath,"I have been unable to back up my chats since 18th April. The backup size also keeps increasing everytime I start it anew, and it has currently reached 1.1 gb. My Google account has auto-sync turned on, whatsapp is fully updated too. The bar stays full at 100% for hours, but the backup never uploads, with a message showing ""Google storage experiencing issues"" when it stops. I have done the recommended procedures in the app, but nothing is helping. Please look into this matter. Edit: Same again",3
Danish Siddique,"Hello, the latest WhatsApp update has introduced changes that I find quite inconvenient. Earlier, status updates were displayed in a straightforward vertical list, which I preferred. Now, they’re arranged in a horizontal format, which feels less user-friendly. Additionally, the Updates tab is now filled with channels and their options, which I don’t find useful. The previous design was simpler and more practical. I hope WhatsApp reconsiders and brings back the older layout. Thanks",1
Jeremy “AshReal” Spencer,"(edited) thanks WhatsApp! I only have one more conplain. Unlike Iphone, WA here doesn't have the feature to preview the cut part on Status. Preview as in hovering the ""start"" or ""end"" part of the video and we can see which or what happen at the part we're about to cut off or end at(same goes with start). This will helps a lot on posting a precise short videos or clips without having to rewatch the vids from the beginning. Edited: now my animated stickers won't animating. Fix this asap",2
Anthony Thompson,"You guys should have fixed the hanging issue on android by now. It freezes or doesn't respond when I want to take screenshot, I just missed two important calls. The android system basically freezes when using WhatsApp. I dont know if it's a samsung only issue or all android. Cus my friends who has the same issue are all using samsung. It's been almost a year if not more and still hasn't been rectified. I was forced to come here to complain. It's really frustrating.",2
Mustafa Shararah,"The addition of the voice chat option in group chats without a way to disable it or move it anywhere else on the screen is truly astonishing. It replaces a fundamental (scroll to the bottom feature) area, that should be empty when reading recent chat, because now it covers the two-ticks as well, and is just above the send button so it's accidentally hit multiple times. Give us an option to disable this feature and to disable meta AI when trying to tag users. All we need is a disable option.",1
ryu,"once again, i don't understand the unnecessary need to modernise and change everything in this app. the newest update changes the ""typing..."" feature into a text bubble instead, which was, AGAIN, completely unnecessary & looks off. why change something that worked perfectly fine before? features like this should be optional, as not everyone copes well with change. PLEASE have more regard for your users, if it's not broken stop fixing it. as soon as you get used to a layout, they change it AGAIN.",1
robodu,"This app used to work well for what it was worth but sometime this year, it began freezing and crashing incessantly on my phone so much that I couldn't use it. Mind you, it only happens on this app, every other app works smoothly. Researched and found out that this is a very common problem with WhatsApp on Samsung phones. Pls fix it! This is very annoying",1
Daniel Osawaru,"19th/11/24 The app has been going through some changes the past few months with some good and some very questionable. AI, drafts, and other good features where added but please make it easier to navigate the status page, just take it back to how it used to look where everything was vertical and not horizontal. Thank you",5
Moses Owoseni,"Whatsapp is a good app generally, but I've been having issues with the status updates. I can't see the status updates of my contacts that they posted and it has not expired, its usually frustrating when I ask them about stuff and they'll be like they've posted it already. I updated Whatsapp and it still happens. Then the status is usually disorganized. This bug should be fixed in the next update. Thanks.",2
Isaac Gideon,"This is to draw your attention to some issues that Samsung Galaxy A series users have been facing for a while now. WhatsApp doesn't work properly on these devices, especially Samsung Galaxy A15. I think it's an issue of conflicting softwares. Upon opening WhatsApp, my phone begins to lag, the screen jitters and touches are delayed. This only happens when WhatsApp is opened. I'm calling for the development team to look into this issue and help provide a solution that solves this. Thanks.",3
Asemahle Hlabahlaba,"The app is great but then the problem comes at the statuses. When ever I send a picture or especially videos, WhatsApp completely changes the quality of the video and it's really irritating and annoying. I don't care about any changes WhatsApp makes but all I ask for is the ability to send videos in their original quality .😐😊. A new feature that must added is that we can now react to statuses. I mean like... HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE!!",4
Charlotte Akabogu,"I've been using this app for years now and may i say, I LOVE IT! Unlike other apps that i dislike within a couple of minutes. One thing I don't like about it is that I can't pin more than 3 messages, and for someone that receives a lot of messages, it takes a while to locate the important ones. So I hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Another thing is that when a message is pinned in a group chat, everyone sees it. And that's nice but there's no privacy for only one person.",4
Travel to Paddle,"Getting worse and they don't care. I woke up to find my account with all chats and media gone forever. No warning, no explanation, no message. This has happened to several friends recently all without reason. I tried to contact them but the support option is fake. After trying to refuse me a support ticket I finally got a bot which gave me a block of useless text then closed my case. No humans, no support, no reason for several accounts disappearing and no reason to ever trust whatsapp again.",1
Igbe Emily,"This new algorithm is very bad, if I want to post a picture it takes 4 to 6 minutes before the picture will load talk more of been posted, the fact that the time arrangement features of the statuses are based on frequently texted is annoying, I hate this app,please do something about that delay from when I'm about to post a picture cus it's extremely annoying",1
Your Trucking,Calls could be better for example: I am on a call to a friend and they are saying something it decided to mute what they ate saying or I understand the last few words. The messaging side is ok 👍 Uploading large videos sometimes takes its time and no its not my interent I have sent large files on another platform in shorter time. Following these improvements you would score 4/5 To gain the final star it would be beneficial to make a photo folder to easily access new and old images.,3
david austin,"I had a companion device linked up to my primary device, my messages were wiped out suddenly in my companion device so I tried to log out and log in again to see whether the problem will resolve. Upon relinking and logging in I lost all my important files as WhatsApp wiped everything out without my any significant information given. All I saw was ""WHATSAPP WILL CLOSE"" before I logged out and that's how my files were wiped out from my phone memory. A clear message should have been shown.",1
Bassem Negm,"WhatsApp is eating my phone storage. it shows user data 29GB. I tried cleaning all media and even deleted whole chats. and nothing changes, my phone stops working sometimes cause it's running out of storage. what is user data and where can I find it. your live help can't even help! Update: it's now 58+ GB and counting. And not receiving messages or sending anymore. And no support at all.",1
Ritwika Goswami,"There should be an option to disconnect WhatsApp from Internet connection. Edit: It's a number based platform which allows to receive incoming calls, however scams and unwanted callers call too. There should be an option to stop receiving calls from unknown numbers. They can call/text us only if we allow them to. Without this feature it's getting dangerous to use this app, just can't switch because of official reasons.",1
Bella Pearl,"For some reason my locked chats folder is no longer visible. The only responses I got from WhatsApp was from their bot, that after offering solutions that I tried and none worked said it was puzzled. Rather than a human agent entering the chat, the bot changed the subject and said that they don't provide support for the other subject that has nothing to do with my matter. Then it stopped responding. Do better WhatsApp. I have work-related chats I cannot access because of this failing.",1
Elsa G.,"Recently, I've been having issues with sending messages to specific chats. I will open one chat and send the message, and it shows that it went elsewhere. I literally almost sent sensitive information to the wrong person, and no, I'm not mistaking the chats. This has happened a few times",3
NARUTO AMV,"WhatsApp is the best at what it offers. However, since the last major update on its voice & video call user interface, the ""end-to-end encryption"" appears before the ""calling/ringing"" information on top of the screen. That is so annoying when you are in a hurry and want to see whether or not that contact is online via the ringing info. Remove the ""end-to-end encryption"" message above the call or just put it somewhere else! That's not as important as knowing if that contact is online or not.",1
Champagne Supremacy,"WhatsApp is really great, but I wish they had a scheduling feature for sending messages in the standard version. There are so many times when I need to text someone at inconvenient moments, and having this feature would seriously save the day and make my experience so much better. I really hope I can reach out to the team about this. Thanks!",3
Lavish Vasita,"I’ve been using WhatsApp for a very long time and always trusted it as a reliable platform. However, the recent update is really disappointing. Messages are not delivered on time, which completely disrupts communication. This is unacceptable from such a reputed app that millions depend on. I hope the team addresses these issues quickly because this is not the standard we expect from WhatsApp.",1
Michael Zeblon,"Whatsapp is a very useful and amazing app... But this new update is insanely terrible. The status/updates section is now wack, I prefer the vertical look over the horizontal layout, and being able to sort of get a preview of the status before clicking. Etc. It would have been much better if status/updates and channels had separate sections, that way it would go back to having that iconic horizontal layout. And channels would be there for... Whoever needs it.",5
Adeola Adeyemi,"WhatsApp is an amazing app; kudos to the brains behind it! However, I don't like how my contact status is displayed. I have to swipe over... contacts or search. I find that feature very annoying and stressful. Can it be rectified? If yes, please help! I'm dissatisfied at the moment. The feature came on in less than 24hours. I need help to get it back to how it was, I can't deal with this new feature displayed on my screen.",1
sudman arpon,"Since the last update you cannot resume a call on hold, there is literally no option to resume like previously. The only thing you can do is end the call..after making the person wait on line, it's horrible. And the auto rotation, is still completely broken now. When it's supposed to be in landscape it's portrait and vise versa. It cuts off most of the video cause it's in the wrong Orientation. And with picture in picture mode.. it's so much worse.",1

Sean Connolly,"While I like WhatsApp for the ability to call family and friends, the most annoying feature is the chat backup feature. Even though I have this feature turned off and don't want it, I keep getting reminders on my phone that my chats aren't backed up.

So i dont need to switch back and forth my tabs cause of the call ends automatically.",1
Janice Foo,"Having problem getting a verification code when switching to new phone, once the sms failed to verify, have to wait for 8 hours to get the sms verification again. Tried voice call but the message wasn't clear, when failed, have to wait for 30 minutes again. Kindly allow at least 3 times for sms verification as we are not very clear on transferring to new phone because we don't change phone so often. Really frustrating.",3
Lyn O,This would have been a 5-star app if it offered the Message Scheduling feature! Also why did the photo selection feature change to not allow us to expand the photos from within the gallery view any more? It's difficult for us to ensure the correct photos are selected if there's no immediate way of expanding it to confirm.,2
Erin de Blois,"my only complaint is that pop up notifications are no longer allowed for ""my version of Andriod"" (Samsung S23, fully up to date so it's not like it's an outdated version of Android) and I no longer get notifications on my lock screen (presumably because of the pop up notification issue), which is disappointing. Otherwise I love the app and have no complaints.",4
Brooklyn Snyman,"I've never really had any problems with the app before and it's really good for everything, calling, messaging and so on but I noticed that recently whenever I try to post a video, not only is the video blurry but it takes long to send and not only that, it says didn't send. I don't blame this on the internet connection because it is working perfectly fine. I tried to post the same video multiple times but it just wasn't sending. It's really frustrating because I have reasons. Please fix this.",3
You tube,I can't see the Meta AI button or icon in search bar. 1. Updated to the latest version. It is supported in my country and I have more than 80 gb of storage space left. 2. Can see meta ai when connected as a companion device. 3. Unable to see when connected as a standalone device.,3
Salman Farsi,"I request the developer team to hide the numbers of archive chats from incoming messages to the home page. its really irritating and disturbing at the same time as I did not want any notification from those chats.

Henrix,"The art of ruining what was good. After the last update, the screen will turn off after reproducing an audio message or voice note, and I have to press the power button so the screen comes back. The app keeps functioning normally, it's the screen that goes black for a few seconds. Like this wasn't enough, after the screen comes back to normal, I can't pause the audio anymore. This issue makes the app nearly unusable. Fix ASAP.",1
Macyla Meyer,"I don't really know what to say,I've never really had a problem with whatsapp, It's just recently I can't put vids on my status, if it does allow me, it's just a black screen but doesnt play anything, it's like there's nothing, and I can't see people's status (which are also videos), it does this every once in a while, but it's done it completely now, I've tried everything. It's starting to irritate me so so much. Other then this,it's a pretty good app(when it doesnt have its moments sometimes)",3
Dennis Shia,"Thanks. This apps is used as a substitute to SMS (or text in US), but please note that there is a bug especially for the most Bluetooth headsets, Usually most call (outside WhatsApp) hang up and the audio switch directly to ""audio"", especially when playing a music or watching a video, but when I got a call in WhatsApp, they only remain in ""calls"" after they hang up. It's really annoying that I have to turn the phone call audio off in order to swtch back to ""audio"" again.",5
John Sullivan,"Every update brings improvements but also new bugs downgrades. When attaching gallery the new proprietary-ish UI fails to offer Browse and Search the older one had those. When adding reactions, the reactions sometimes don't show at the bottom of groupings of photo/media consistently. Minor things, but how such things gets missed is worrying. There's no direct way to give this feedback so public on the app store it is then.",4
Janet Mustapha-Esteve,"For over or about 6 months now, my WhatsApp messenger has been frustrating me. My phone hangs each time I open the WhatsApp. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. I had even wiped off the data on it. It's still doing the same. At first, I thought it was my phone storage, and I kept on deleting files on my phone. It's still the same thing. If the fault was from my phone, it would affect my WhatsApp business, too. I just uninstalled it now and am currently downloading it now.",1
Pottleby,"WhatsApp has always been an amazing app. However, there's room for improvement. Voice messages transcript is one of it. If you have more variations for choosing the languages, that would be great. Because some of the countries, they use more than 1 language. Also, we still can't choose to be or not to activate the voice message transcripts. We may accidentally off the voice message transcript and turn out to redownload and activate it again, which is quite frustrating.",4
Tharde Peter,"WhatsApp is a good messaging app. The new updates like mentioning friends on status and customising themes is really dope. However, there are some mistakes that have not been corrected. I thought it would but after about 5 updates, the error still remains. 1. It should go back to being arranged according to latest uploads. 2. When I send a text and close WhatsApp, it appears as though the message was left on read until I send another text. 3. Showing different time from when message was sent.",2
Jewel Barua,"WhatsApp is a popular and easy-to-use messaging app that offers free text, voice, and video calls over the internet. It has end-to-end encryption for privacy, supports group chats, and allows sharing of media and files. The app also features clear voice/video calls and Status updates that disappear after 24 hours. Overall, WhatsApp is a reliable, secure, and cost-effective way to stay connected globally. Highly recommended!",5
Alif H. S.,"Some bugs pops-up lately, especially when scrolling through a group chat, and channel, it keeps on skip-scrolling up. And there's also an update issue in channel, there's a late update where a channel has updated more than 5 and I only received 2 or 3 updates. These are just 2 out of much more bugs that I experienced. Please fix these bugs instead of adding more feature to the app. Thanks",2
Ali Mazhar,"""WhatsApp is my go-to messaging app! It's easy to use, reliable, and offers end-to-end encryption for secure conversations.

Overall, WhatsApp is a great choice for everyday messaging!""",5
Nicole Ashby,"Worst support ever. Can't even open the app without it crashing. Tried to use the ""Help"" option and if you want to have an actual person try to look at your issue, forget about it.

Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable communication app.",5
Hassan Abubakar,"WhatsApp is a nice messaging app however, I would like some features to be looked into. 1. Make it possible for someone on the other side of a call between 2 persons to be able to mute the other person's audio. This would help mitigate unnecessary noise sometimes. 2. When uploading a photo or video there was room to see what you want to upload, put a caption, filter or anything of such but now it's no longer like that. Please look into this. Generally the app is okay though.",4
Prabhat Racherla,"The pay icon that has appeared in the input text area is very annoying. Whenever I want to send messages to someone I accidentally end up clicking on it. That's the wrong place to put that. Its annoying. Like there are 3 places from where you can pay someone. Why do you need 3? Its not at all user friendly. You have attach, pay, camera, voice record. All next to each other. It's a phone not a laptop that you can squeeze so many in the same place.",1
Daniela Parra,"With the new update, The camera on Whatsapp doesn't work properly. Sometimes goes black, or it says captured failed, so I have to take photos wuth my phone's camera instead, making the process longer., Another thing, is that sometimes doesn't let me do videos either, and again, I have to record with my phone's camera. Furthermore, it is difficult to find photos that I want to send, as it doesn't show my photo folders, it only shows recent photos. Samsung A53",4

Its sick, but it for some reason isn't compatible with ""Side-by-side view""",5
Shivamani Beemanadham,"You are rolling out the reactions to messages feature, which is good. Could you please introduce the Double Tap feature too, like in Instagram? It is much needed.

Craig Johnson,"WhatsApp is WhatsApp, there's no going back now. However here's a BUG REPORT: on Android (in my experience), listening to audio messages/files is a mess. Once playing, the screen goes black/the phone locks. When unlocked, the embedded player is then unresponsive and the audio plays through the earpiece and not the speaker. The user has to shut down the app to stop the audio. I share a lot of audio messages with my bandmates so this would be a deeply appreciated fix. Thank you Zuck.",4
Facu Pudenti,"a few things: first there should be an option to disable backup of gifs. Second, statuses are very confusing for older people.

Sheikh,"It's not as good and flawless as it used to be. Edited messages are not sent sometimes. Sometimes, I edit the message, but the change doesn't show until I exit the app and open it again.

ATIF Pathan,As much as I love Whatsapp and have had great experiences. Lately I've been having a constant issue with my WhatsApp. If I select multiple videos to upload to status the videos will play it sound but show the thumbnail of tre next video And sometimes when I view images on my status that I uploaded the images won't display on full screen. It will display halfway and it will be transparent where I can see the videos/images of my status in the background,5
Mior Hafidz [D],"The only lack I see is that it doesn't have the feature that enables user to make customizable status privacy. Instead of only ""My contacts"", ""My contacts except..."", and ""Only share with..."". User can have variety of options for status privacy.

I have updated, deleted and redownload the app several times but no improvements. Please can you fix this bug???",2
Shwetha Shashi,"WhatsApp is hands down the best messaging app out there! It's super fast, easy to use, and packed with features like voice and video calls, group chats, and media sharing. The end-to-end encryption makes chats secure, and the seamless sync across devices is a game changer. Whether for personal or professional use, WhatsApp keeps me connected effortlessly. Highly recommended!🫰✨",5
Hwee San,"Think the new transcript option is useless? Cannot transcript if we are talking in chinese.. if want to have this option, then make it universal.. english and chinese is basic. And it is soooo soft when we make phone calls. Couldn't hear the other party voice at all! Voice messages play by ear is also very soft. Please improve. Thanks.",2
Soumyadeep Acharyya,"Love the new WhatsApp look! Easy to use with the bottom bar. But, it's annoying when calling someone who's offline, it doesn't say they're offline and countinues to ring. Please fix! Edit: I've got an idea. Can you add different sections of file format in groups? Like PDF, Images, Videos and gifs so that it'll be easier to watch them seperately in their own compilation so that my group will never be messy because of chats and it'll not be very difficult to find it.",4
Zita Maria,"Some ideas for your next updates 1. Please Introduce scheduling messages 2. Allow us take screenshot of profile pictures like before 3. A way of saving a video statuses from others because sometimes they mightnt see the message requesting for that status on time. Other than that, the apps nice and the updates of video messaging, channels, sending HD pictures, editing messages after being sent, among the rest are very nice. Do you even care about our reviews???",3
Noel C,"App crashing for the last 4 days. Cannot open it, originally said there was a bug. Uninstalled and installed the app several times along with restarting my phone. Still won't open. When I logged in on another phone it said I was banned due to Spam. I haven't being spamming and this came without a warning. Help center has been of no help since Friday. I don't know how to get it working again",2
Chikere Vivian,"""I've been a loyal WhatsApp user for years, appreciating the efforts to improve the app. However, the recent update has been disappointing the video quality on WhatsApp Status has deteriorated. Despite uploading high-quality videos, they appear blurry, whereas they look great on other apps. I've ensured my phone settings are set to HD, but the issue persists.Another frustrating change is the rearrangement of Status updates. They're no longer displayed in chronological order, making it difficult",2
Muhammad,"Hi here are a few suggestions you can consider for future updates. Do consider adding customisation for downloading media. The current version is good where it can download specifically what media for mobile data and wifi. However it would be great if each individual chat would have the customisation as well.

Archie 221B,"The chat transfer to new device is close to impossible to do successfully, same with Gdrive backup, just loads forever. I've been waiting DAYS.

There's only 2 options for chat history transfer and neither work. Additionally, most other apps have the entire chat history once you log in. Failed me.",1
Pradeep Singh,"In the latest update of WhatsApp, there is a bug. When we change the color of chat, the normal double ticks and double blue ticks on the sent messages look similar (white in color). Users can't confirm whether they have been seen or not by the receiver. Please fix this bug.",4

Mano Rajput,"December 30, 2024 From my point of view, WhatsApp is a fantastic messaging app that makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family. I appreciate its simplicity and the ability to send messages, share photos, and make voice or video calls for free. The end-to-end encryption gives me peace of mind about privacy. However, I also see the downside of constant notifications and the pressure to respond quickly. Overall, I think WhatsApp is a great tool for communication, as long as it’s used mi",5
Conroy Thorpe,"I trust that everyone is good and that I will receive a response ASAP. This has been the second time I woke up to see where a Mac device is linked to my WhatsApp. I've never once paired my application with another device, yet it seems someone is able to hack into it without a QR code. Can this issue be looked into immediately.",1
EILEEN IHEJIRIKA,"The list feature worked for a while on my app before disappearing. A star has been docked to get your attention. Otherwise it's a Great app. Amazing UI. Just a suggestion, could there be an adjustment to section the groups just like the communities? It would really help with sorting and organisation. Also, kindly move the archives to below the chats. It kinda defeats the purpose if I can always see it. Thank you.",4
Sandra Roberts,"Hello, WhatsApp team. I have been facing an issue since the latest update. All the names of my family members and friends are missing and their phone numbers are visible, and it's bit frustrating since it's been a week. At first I thought it's a normal issue and it will get fixed automatically on it's own, but it didn't. I hope WhatsApp team will review the matter and fix this bug soon. Thank you.",3
Noushad Nizar Ali (Noushad's Intuitions),"WhatsApp is a great messaging app with useful features, but the Channels layout needs improvement. After subscribing to a channel, the Status tab shifts horizontally, making it less user-friendly. It would be better to have a separate tray for Channels instead of cluttering the Status section. This would improve accessibility and user experience. Hope WhatsApp considers this in future updates!",5
Thorricane Thornado,"Ok, so uh, W updates so far, but there's one I literally just thought of right now, it just popped up in my head. You know how we can search for past messages while in a group and also search for messages straight from the home page of Whatsapp, how about you add a feature were we can search for mentions/tags, like inside a group, just a button that will send you to all your previous mentions/tags, so we don't have to worry about missing them when the group is flooded with tons of messages.",5
Kate Venter,"Hi I'm having some issues and need some help. When I go into the app, it just closes by itself. I've cleared cache, deleted and reinstalled the app, and nothings working.

A_ndre,"Always been a great and reliable app.. However with the forced roll-out of 'Meta services', my previous 4 star rating is no longer fitting. I understand the world is moving towards AI and that's great if you care, but I don't.

O Redmond,"Recent update Now I can't upload and send photos from specific albums in my phones camera library. I could before, and this was vital to my work. But now, when you select to upload a photo and browse albums, there are only 5 to choose from: camera, WhatsApp, downloads, video, or screenshots. I have dozens of albums saved that hold separate photos, downloads, videos, etc, and now I can't locate any of them to send content from these files. Well done, WhatsApp. Well done.",1
Daniel Bächli,"Top-tier app, but UI inconsistency with the blue double checkmark. Next to a message, it means the message was read. On the Info screen, it’s just a header for the read timestamp. This is misleading, especially if read receipts are disabled. In that case, messages never show a blue checkmark, yet the Info screen still does, possibly suggesting the message was read. A small UI tweak could improve clarity.",5
Habiba Chowdhury,"Good...WhatsApp remains one of the most popular messaging apps, but there are areas in which it could improve. The interface feels a bit dated compared to some modern alternatives. Adding more customization options for themes and chat layouts would enhance the user experience.

While it’s reliable for messaging and calls, an update to the overall look and",3
Disa Prajapati,"After switching to pixel 9 the app constantly crashes. The reason for this happening is when I use the feature built into the phone where we can go backwards to the previous screen. What makes the app crash is, from the main page if I click on a WhatsApp notification, respond, and then swipe ""back"", the app instantly crashes. Also, responding to any message with an reaction crashes the app. This has been occuring for months now.",2
Jo Ku,"It just to be better. Now editing text is much worse: cant position the cursor in middle of the text, instead it just picks a whole word. So to add a word mid sentence, you basically need to first delete another. Secondly image sharing doesn't show whole image, only a square of it. In practice, to share a specific image, you need to first check it in phone's gallery and then remember which image you wished to share.",2
The Real Seidel,"Overall good, but it's getting worse. Messages sometimes don't get pushed and come in when opening the app. Same with incoming (video)calls. It suddenly says you have 3 missed calls and people texting me why I'm not picking up. The ""typing bubble"" like in FB messenger makes the text jump up and down, annoying feature when responding on a certain reaction. Move it back in the ""modus"" under contacts' name. Selecting emojis takes up half the screen, with half of it empty. Good job Meta.",3
Alice Pierce,"Good app but transferring everything to a new phone is a nightmare. It took me 4 hours of frustration. The QR code transfer kept freezing up, taking about an hour and 7 attempts. Then it was struck on ""initialising"" for 2 hours (tried everything). Eventually had to make an online backup (another hour), delete all my chats from both the old phone and the new, and reinstall with the backup. Finally worked. Please, do something about this. I had imagined a nicer way to spend my Sunday.",2
Hafizi Musa,"Hi WhatsApp, I love your app and how it connects people. However, I've noticed some issues I'll like the team to include in one of their future releases. 1. An edit option for the status update. This will make updating status more user friendly and lessen the burden of deleting in situations where there's an oversight. 2. There should be validation error in times you exceed the character limit while typing a text status update so I don't see a shorter text after hitting send without notice.",5
Michael Edozie,"In the previous versions, whenever my phone is in silent mode and I'm watching stories and statuses, the videos don't play audio and I really enjoyed it that way.

I also have an issue with whatsapp calling, I'm not getting notifications that someone is calling and if I try to ring, it shows as though it's connecting but not.",4
Ankit Bilolikar,A very good messenger. All you features are excellent. Recently added privacy point that no one can take a screenshot of profile photo is just great like you always say 'end to end encrypted'. According to me I think that you want to add a one more feature that shows the list of peoples from contact who seen our profile photo. It should be come out over rolling days. I really hope you add this feature as soon as possible. Anyway yours application is the best ever.,5
Xypleth,"Color space management/conversion is horrible. Turns shared images green, shifts/desaturates color. Only in this app, when sharing photos that are captured with Samsung default settings, they get badly converted to a different color space and/or don't include ICC profile, and they show up with wrong colors.

Please address this issue ASAP.",1

Also, we can’t zoom in on photos anymore, which is a big issue, especially for office documents. Sometimes, I take a screenshot of a friend's DP for birthday statuses. WhatsApp should allow users to control DP visibility while preventing screenshots without permission. These changes would improve the user experience.",2

Audra White,"WhatsApp used to be a simple messaging app—now it’s a privacy nightmare wrapped in endless monetization schemes. Meta wants your data, your attention, and eventually, your wallet.

Antonia Sohm,"The last update has me almost avoiding the app. The new way to share media is horrible in my opinion. I'd like to see the full picture/video before I send it. Now this process got much longer because you have to click on the really small icon when you want to edit, cut or just look at the file before sending. I guess it's more convenient when you are 100% sure what you want to send, but who is all the time? Also we can't listen to voice messages with leaving the app anymore? Bummer.",4

A big problem is that it claims to keep your privacy by encrypting chat messages, and yet at the same time if you are added to any group, your phone number is visible to everyone to save, spam and use. It's an app that started good but never really grew past a certain and point. Would not recommend.",2

Well done 👏 Please make it POSSIBLE for an administrator to be able to add contact numbers to groups without saving the number to their contact list first. It's crazy sometimes!

Please the problem should be fixed on time. It has disrupted so many things In case of emergency I can't send photos and videos to contacts and status it goes blank and loading for a very long time without going through. It's so frustrating and devastating. The recent update is good but VERY SLOW. Please work on it.,1
J De,"The new (as of early 2025) ""gallery"" interface is bad. It used to let you pick from the phone's stock gallery (Samsung), which gave easy and sensible access. Now it's a subpar custom interface. Bad in its photo mode, and even worse when it sometimes requires you ultimately, when it's not from the first few photo folders, to pick using an Android stock FILE manager.",2
James Gibbons,"This is a review for the latest Android version: This app used to be good, now it has a couple of issues. I don't like the new bubble that says when someone is typing, why can't I just choose for it to say a person is 'typing'. The most annoying bug is if you have typed out a long message then want to attach an image, when you go to add the image it loses everything you have typed. You need to remember to add the image(s) first, then add your message as a caption, WHY?!?",3
Ali Raza,"WhatsApp is an excellent communication app that’s easy to use and highly reliable. Its end-to-end encryption ensures privacy, and features like group chats, voice notes, and video calls make it versatile for both personal and professional use. However, it could improve by introducing more customization options and better storage management. Overall, it’s a must-have app for staying connected.",4
Michelle Duong,Change the UI back to November 2024. There is no need to have a dedicated text box when attaching media. It's also very annoying how the message is deleted if you type it first (in the regular text box) and attach a photo afterwards to send. Just reverse it. This is a change that is not necessary and makes the experience less practical.,3
Allen Sunil (Alien),"It’s absolutely maddening that this glitch has been around for 5-6 months without a single fix. Every time I listen to audio, the screen goes into sleep mode, and I’m completely stuck. I can’t pause, adjust the volume, or do anything until the audio ends. It’s beyond frustrating that something so basic is still broken. Do the developers even care? This issue disrupts everything and makes the app unbearable to use. Fix this now—this level of neglect is unacceptable and exhausting!",1
Ini David,"Since I installed the update, uploading pictures to my status and sharing to contacts has been a huge problem. Videos takes forever to upload and the status update is just scattered. Now, status aren't updated according to time. It's so annoying. For 2 days now, I haven't been able to send pictures or upload them on my status. You guys should look into it.",1
S,What is with the new update?!If you're attaching a photo to a message the original message is lost. Have to retype the whole thing just in a bizarrely bad editor? Why is the add-caption editor now so different to the normal message editor? Why can you not paste text into it? Why can you not move the cursor without a weird magnifying effect that actually makes it almost impossible to get the cursor where you want it to be? What a mess.,1
New Generations,"1. After the call is connected and within 10 seconds I get a poor connection error every time. Every time I get this poor connection error, after some time I am able to get back to the call automatically. This happens every time. This is a big bug. 2. Photo sharing, no photo preview show. Only dark screen visible. Unable to crop photo due to black screen.",1
Robin Penny,"When you attach a picture to a message u r writing, WhatsApp throws away the message without warning and just sends the picture. Very annoying if you have written a long message! Also unable to find a way to select a picture from alternative folders (I had created a folder called Pictures under DCIM). I think it's using it's own media viewer. Couldn't find another way to report problems - so doing as a review (The Report bug option is currently missing from Settings)",3
Mike Yag,Unfortunately I have to use WA because some of my clients do. This is the worst messenger ever written. Absolutely inhuman interface and total absence of logic behind it. Worst backup system in the world. Worst organized access to media files. Whatever you use is an example of how NOT to do this function. I would be happy to give it ZERO stars but have no option. If you can afford not to use WA don't use it. Anything is better than it.,1
JOEH SPARTAN,"WhatsApp automatically updates its database and other vulnerable files on my device, causing it to work slowly, consume excessive storage space, and potentially expose my device to viruses and malware. Additionally, I've noticed that around 100 unknown stickers have been downloaded to my device, despite not having any stickers pack installed. Even after deleting files, the problem persists, affecting the app's performance and compromising my device's security. Please fix this.",2
Adepoju Oluwadunmininu,"I love using WhatsApp, but I think it would be amazing if I could edit my status updates after posting them. Sometimes I catch a typo or want to add more context, but currently, I have to delete and re-post.Having an 'Edit Status' feature would greatly enhance the overall user experience, allowing users to quickly correct mistakes or update their status without having to re-post.",3
Winston Mwamande,"I love the text 'edit' feature after you send a text. So here is an idea, instead of long pressing the specific text... Why not just allowing a person to tap the text 4 times. Like how when you want to tag a message, you just swipe the text bar right. Also, this new update is taking way longer to upload a media file when sending it.",4
Muneera Sheriff,"Overall, it's a good app, but there are a few things that could be improved. One key request: please enable the View Once option when selecting multiple images or videos to send. It would make sharing private content more convenient. Also, about the Last Seen privacy settings—if Y has turned it off for X, but X hasn’t done the same for Y, why restrict Y from seeing X's last seen? Let each user’s privacy settings work independently instead of playing judge in the middle! 😂",4
Temiloluwa Olaoya,"I don't like the new update where status updates of people I frequently chat with are moved to the top. It's so annoying, confusing, and makes everything look scattered. Since updating yesterday, I can't send pictures to anyone or post pictures on my status. The screen just goes blank, and I have to exit WhatsApp and reopen it. Please fix these issues urgently! Update: it's now back to normal, but kindly add the feature where we can add emojis back to the text status update😊👍",3
squishy tomato,"App has become UNUSABLE since a couple of weeks..Seems to have a bug with sending messages - sometimes when you hit send, there is a red exclamation mark for a second, then the message appears to be sent but when you leave the chat and reopen it the message has disappeared. Impossible to sustain a conversation now. I have updated my phone software and run a scan for malware, I don't think the problem is on my phone. Tried to contact WhatsApp but only got an automated reply. Very frustrated.",1
Abhay kumar,"Earlier, when I tried to call someone on WhatsApp who was already on another call, it used to show a message like ""The person is busy on another call."" This feature was really helpful because it let us know the person was unavailable. Now, this message no longer appears, and it just keeps calling even if the person is on another call. It’s confusing and makes it harder to figure out if the person is busy or not. I really miss this feature and hope WhatsApp brings it back. It made things easy.",3
Anna Rebeka Majzik,"DO NOT UPDATE!! 1) If you write your message first and then add a picture to it, it doesn't send. I literally had whole paragraphs disappear after attaching a picture. 2) can only see 7 gallery folders. The ""see"" more option isn't always visible 3) Attaching pictures: previously, you just clicked on the big green button after selecting the pictures you wanted and you could customise your messages after. Now they added a tiny edit button across the screen. 4)the typing pop up bubble is annoying",1
Bee A Unicorn,"It's a great app and all, I use it for my primary communication...but I must say the audio quality is trash, when I upload a picture or video on my status, the quality is trash and the video call quality is also trash. Also, notifications of new messages are inconsistent and sometimes show up 5 minutes after the contact has sent the message. Nevertheless, it's my primary messaging app and I wish the media quality was tip-top, otherwise the app is great.",3
Marvellous Chukwukelu,"You guys made a feature that allowed me to have the account for two numbers. When I switched so that I could have it on the same phone, you erased the entire history for a number I have had for years. Your automatic backup doesn't work. I have to keep doing it manually. You don't send notifications for both accounts. No matter how many times I change the settings, you always stop sending the notifications for one of them and I don't realize that I am missing messages en masse. I hate this app.",1
Zuni,"If we talk about seen1 SMS, then this is a great feature of WhatsApp, but one problem that has been recurring and which has killed the purpose of this feature is that receivers are misusing this feature by taking pictures of their screens, so I think it is necessary to introduce an update that when an SMS is sent on Scene One, your profile picture or something similar should not be visible as well as that shows who sent the message. Thank you.",1
Kursin,"Dear Meta Team, I'm providing feedback regarding the AI memory limitation. The current limitation makes it difficult for me to have continuous conversations. I suggest improving the AI's ability to store long-term memory. I suggest enhancing the AI's memory to: 1. Store user information during the same session. 2. Recall previous preferences and topics. 3. Enhance learning and adaptation capabilities. These updates will significantly improve user interaction. Thank you.",3
Somesh,"I noticed a few bugs recently that spoil the user experience. 1. When I edit a message and exit the chat, I still see the old version of the message instead of the updated one. 2. Sometimes after sending a message and leaving the chat, the other user's reply appears as the last message instead of mine. However, when I reopen the chat, my message is displayed as the most recent one, which is a significant bug.",1
Ashok Jhawar,"Recently the emoji tab at the time of writing in status has been removed. It was very helpful. Secondly, the status is the only verticle, where not so much improvement took place. We can't reduce or increase the size of fonts on our own, the type of fonts are very limited, the colour of fonts is also single i e. White only. All these should be taken care of.",4
Sky,"This is my first and last review for this app. I have one problem. Before the update It was possible to clear WhatsApp data by simply going into settings and clicking ""clear data"". Now it's not possible with the recent update, which makes it really frustrating. Now it takes me into a a weird screen when I click ""manage storage "" which was replaced for ""clear data"" . Honestly, it's stupid idea. Now I have to reinstall WhatsApp everytime I need my data to be cleared for personal reasons.",1
Naglaa Kamal,"The last update is very bad, now when I try to attach any photo I have to search through everything as they appear as recent, when I hit the folders tab and choose any photo it won't attach and kicks me back to recent folder. Also the edit option isn't clear like before. You are improving the app or messing it up. Also what is that option of AI ?? I don't need any AIs. Stop what you are doing to ""improve"" as actually you are screwing it and get everything as it was.",1
Sqweebo,As many others have pointed out this app is not as good as it once was. How do they managed to 'develop' the app and just ruin it? Just created a long message to accompany a photo. When editing the message it becomes impossible to edit. Starts enlarging and deleting text . I couldn't get out of it until it eventually deleted all the text I had typed. I know there are cutbacks everywhere these days. Seem they got rid of their developers too!,3
toyin olakehinde,"WhatsApp has always been an amazing app ever since I started using it. It's reliable and user-friendly. However, after updating to the latest version, I’ve encountered some frustrating issues. Sending pictures, receipts, or posting photos on my status and contact list has become very stressful. I can’t access these features properly anymore. Please look into resolving this issue. Aside from this, great work on the app overall",1
Brembo Jefe,"It's a good messaging app to keep in touch with friends and family. However having a diverse amount of people that I chat to and post status updates for... it becomes tedious to always select which contacts can view my status updates, as sometimes the content may not be appropriate for everyone I chat to. I then suggest having ""status groups"" where I can easily select which group of contacts, can view my status updates depending on the content that is posted.",3
Olamilekan Ayinla (Olami),"WhatsApp is hands down the best messaging app out there! It's fast, reliable, and packed with amazing features like end-to-end encryption, voice and video calls, group chats, and seamless media sharing. The user interface is simple and easy to navigate, making communication effortless. With constant updates and new features like disappearing messages, multi-device support, and communities, it keeps getting better. Whether for personal or business use, it’s the go-to app for staying connected.",5
David Bosch,"5 Stars until you fix the issue that always says: ""The download could not be completed. Please..."" when looking at statuses from my contacts that are videos. My internet connection is superb. Please change it because it is freaking annoying. I alwayw have to tap forward and then back and then it MIGHT show me again this error and i can repeat it until I get so annoyed that I leave the status. Also, I cannot screenshot any profile pictures anymore. That is so annoying.",1
Pietro Panino,"23-12-2024 update It could be another great improvement choosing for every single media in a chat to be saved or not directly along the chat itself, maybe putting a botton just next to the media (""save yes/no""). This can make possibile to see the preview of the media without removing it from the chat sight. It's so frustrating having phone memory always full because of a lot of useless media that could be used only for the time they are created. Efficiency, speed, modernity. Thank you.",5
Tehreem Umar,"""Hello WhatsApp Team, I love using WhatsApp and enjoy all its features! However, I'm facing an issue with setting up two-step verification. Despite multiple attempts, I keep getting the error message ""You cannot set up two-step verification. Try again after a few hours."" This issue has been persisting for several days. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and provide a solution.",2
C A,What happened to attachment options with the recent update? I can no longer access my folders in the gallery. Only have access to recent photos which means if I want to attach a photo I have to scroll through all the recent photos in order to find it as opposed to having the option to go through my gallery and see the different folders. Really frustrating! I've stopped using WhatsApp because of this.,1
Noman Akhtar,"Dear what's app. Previously, when sending a video during a conversation, the process was quick and seamless: selecting a video from the gallery would immediately prepare it for sending. However, with the latest update, an additional step has been introduced. After selecting the video, I now have to click on the thumbnail in the bottom corner to confirm before it’s ready to send. This change interrupts the natural flow of conversations, especially when sharing videos quickly. Thank U",5
Divine Dan,"WhatsApp has been amazing with each update. That notwithstanding, the inability to search keywords in text even after using the search button is causing a whole lot of trouble. I have to go all through the chat to find a single line I'm looking for. Amidst other requests, please try to look into this one as it is very pressing. Thank you, but after all, WhatsApp messenger still is the best. For this reason, I'll give it a 4-star until the issue has been resolved. Thank you so much Team WhatsApp",2
Gregory Pippas,"Latest update is a massive downgrade for attaching media. Defaulting straight to a whatsapp specific ""recents"" folder rather than loading the standard gallery where albums are. It now takes multiple presses to get to my albums where it only took one before. You can also no longer hold and swipe to select multiple pictures. Being forced to select the dot in the corner. Which is easy to miss and you end up opening the picture rather than selecting multiple pictures.",1
Isabella G,"Very good as i use this all the time and had it for the past 4 years! About a week ago though it turned my front camera on the app weird and i have been unable to fix it, sacrificing all my messages to uninstall then install it again and it not work. I am quite disappointed about that as i dont have a way to fix it. However now that i think about it, its been since the 16th December update, so could be a bug.",4
Ingrid Tandou,"Since a week ago until now I still have trouble sending image/photo/video directly from the gallery, the screen display is completely dark and the cursor keeps spinning, like it's hanging. Either it took 10-18 minutes or totally failed. But there's no problem for forwarding image/photo/video received to other WA recipients. Now I just found out that infact I also can not send audio file via this WA. Can you please fix this problem a.s.a.p ?",2
Jawad Niazi,"Dear WhatsApp Team, I’d like to suggest an enhancement to media visibility settings. In group chats, I often receive images, videos, and audio files. While I want images and videos visible in my gallery, I prefer audio files to remain hidden in my file manager, as they clutter storage and require manual deletion. Currently, media visibility applies to all file types, which limits control. Adding separate options for images, videos, and audio files would make file management easier and improve ☺",4
oluwafemi adekunle,"My God! This is one of the worst update I've seen in recent. Ever since I updated recently it's been one issue to another. 1st images refuses to load on time either to send to someone or to post on status. Tried deleting a status and to my surprise 5hrs later it's still processing to delete. As if that's not enough, contacts and those I think I blocked??? What's tf is wrong??? Infact this is total rubbish!!! Gutted.",1
Neo Angelo,"I have no issues with the app, though it took me a while to get acquainted with the recent updates, It's okay. However, I'd like to make a suggestion, during the next update, please can you enable us to be able to edit our status. Sometimes mistakes are made during posting and to correct those mistakes, it'll warrant us deleting and starting all over. Please add the editing of statuses. Thank you",4
Anahita Srivastava,"The app is very good when it comes to individual messaging, calling and document sharing. However, the forward feature only allows sending messages to only 5 people at a time which is highly inconvenient for people such as me who have multiple numbers of contacts we have to send messages to. So the change I would like to have in the upcoming update would be that we can forward our messages to as many people as we want and with this, our work will be made much easier as compared to how it is now.",3
Rebecca,"I’m having an issue where the music feature for posting statuses doesn’t show up, even after updating the app. I know this feature is available for others, but I’ve tried everything and it’s still missing for me.

lila mehammed,"WhatsApp is an exceptional messaging app that keeps me connected with friends and family effortlessly . It's user - friendly interface makes sending messages, photos and videos a breeze . I appreciate the end -encryption, insuring my conversations remain private and secure .

Occasionally , I experience minor glitches or connectivity issues, but overall , WhatsApp remains my top choice.",5
Chris.,"The new update stinks. Trying to share a video or photo to someone and my status is tiresome and frustrating. I have to wait for the app to process several selected posts to share to my friends which can even take up to 20 minutes. The previous version was better, and no, it's not about my phone, it is perfectly fine. You're better than, aargh!! do better.",1
Charlie P,"After the recent update if I want to attach a picture to a message. It's 100 times more difficult. I have lots of albums in my phone. When I select the paperclip icon as usual in WhatsApp to attach a picture, I then select ""gallery"" as normal. It then shows ""recent"" photos first, which is normal. At that point, I always tap the down arrow to find the album I want with the picture in it I want to attach but, apart from recents, WhatsApp now only lets me select from 4 albums in my phone !!",1
Moeen Khan,"This app is great. However, I recommend one improvement. Whenever, I write something in search bar, click on any option; after that I want to go back to select another option; I have to write again in search bar. This is the issue. Search bar should keep the search list untill I intentionally escape. I hope you understand what am I trying to say.",4
Adefiju Adefiju,Could I even call it the worst Everyone call chat their friends and family but I am the only one left. Due to loss of accuracy occuring in the app. It has been so tiring I can't even explain without having emotion. Whatsapp is the most commonest app used in my country. So what choice do I have. It could even cause depression. Makes you left out of the communication world. Although it is the worst app I would recommend.🤔😩💢,1
06.OreRuault.6C,"Good app, very useful for everyday use and i recommend this app for every one who wants to be able to comunicate with family, friends, and others easily. but my suggestion for the whats app channel / saluran feature is to provide a ""remove follower"" feature so that channel owners can remove someone from their channel. Keep up the good work!",5
Saharsh Shah,"It would be really helpful if you added a feature where we can rename documents sent by others in such a way that its only visible to us and is easier to access. For example, if there is a college classroom group, and the teachers there send a lot of answerkeys or PDFs, but they dont name them appropriately or leave it as is. It's tough to locate the documents we need. So if we, as a user, were able to rename them for pur personal purposes (only visible to us), then that would be of great help!",4
Brendan Chong,It's getting more annoying when using the latest update. The more update it's get the more bug there is. When listening to voice msg the screen suddenly turn black and become ear speaker hearing. But when you put it near your ears it become loud speaker sound output. Another bug is that when we want to hear speaker sound it become freeze screen and you can't touch anything on the app itself. Unless you screen out. Is this happening to only specific phone brand.,3
Mohammad Alam,"Very nice app. Easy to chat etc. Meta Al is fantastic. From text messages to voice and video calls, WhatsApp makes it possible to communicate in almost every format imaginable. It's also incredibly versatile, offering features like group chats, file sharing, voice messages, and Status updates that keep users connected in different ways. For many, it's become the go-to app for both personal and professional communication. Despite its many advantages, WhatsApp isn't without its limitations.",4
Daniel Kioko,"I've been experiencing ongoing issues with WhatsApp where the app keeps stopping unexpectedly. Despite updating to the latest version, the problem persists. Every few hours or days, the app crashes and refuses to open, forcing me to uninstall and reinstall just to use it again. Even after reinstalling, the issue eventually returns. This is incredibly frustrating, especially since WhatsApp is a crucial communication tool. I’ve tried clearing the cache, restarting my phone.",1
Martin Jelínek,"Come on. Fix the issue with disappearing notifications already! When there are multiple msg notifications, they all disappear when you open one of them (or just whatsapp in general). Thats horrible UX design, no other major app has this issue. You HAVE to know about this so finally fix it. On my Pixel 9 pro, the issue started about 3 months ago. From what I read online, on iPhones its like that for maybe years now! What a hell is going on... It is serious UX design flaw.",1
Nicola ROSE,"There was an update recently that where ""CHAT THEME"" was added. When this option is activated in any chat, you can no longer see when a message sent is read (read receipts are ALWAYS ON). I assume that the reason for the chat theme option was to change the bubble from the monotonous GREEN BUBBLE for everyone's message. Can there be a fixed so the blue ticks can again be seen? Thank you..",2
Daniel Brangman,"Absolutely love using WhatsApp on a daily basis. It's my go-to for staying connected with friends and family. The app is user-friendly and reliable.

Overall, I highly recommend WhatsApp!",5
No Way,"I am so disappointed with WhatsApp. 1st no updates like most users with the songs at the status, 2nd cant change the theme like others, 3rd the folder that shows to send a picture is only 4 or 5, 4th emoji button on the text status disappeared...please fix this 🙂 Update: it says there's a WhatsApp update with the theme or something. WHERE?? I already updated ittttt! Man I cant even access my other folders when I wanna share a picture OR when I want to add a wallpaper. Only downloads, and some!",1
Similoluwa Samuel,"WhatsApp is a great app, but there’s one thing I think could be improved. When I delete a message, the other person gets a notification that says, ‘This message was deleted.’ I feel like this isn’t always necessary and can sometimes cause confusion or awkwardness. It would be much better if the message just disappeared entirely without leaving a trace. This would make the experience smoother and more private, which I think a lot of users would appreciate.""",3
Jane,"Used to be fabulous. But, recently, it has developed numerous glitches: my messages sometimes delete after sending (I do not have disappearing messages switched on), but they don't always; sometimes they don't send at all to recipients but it looks as though they have from my phone; sometimes messages disappear straight away, sometimes after a little while. Incrediblly frustrating because there is no pattern. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and updates are up to date",1
Bogdan Marina,"I've already had two important support issues that weren't addressed. One of them involved backup issues, and the other is not being able to see some messages, as they are being replaced with the usual ""Waiting for this message"" (if you do an online search, both were raised by many other users as well). I was met by support agents who seemed to be purposefully not helpful by not making the effort to understand these issues. Shame, as the development team could do so much better",1
Talitha Wentzel,"Very good app, I would just like to make a recommendation that lists for contacts be shown on the main screen. When a message is received the list can have a notification icon. When you open it you can see the contact that messaged you. Because at this point the lists does not really have a purpose. You divide your contacts accordingly but it is not affective.",4

Edwin Orrueze,"WhatsApp is so great an app for business and leisure. It is continually evolving with thrilling new features. I like the feature that allows us create folders and add contacts to those folders, in addition to the default ones already created by WhatsApp. With this feature I can now sought my charts into groups that help me easily locate and organise my ongoing conversations. Please make rearranged folders to remain so after editing as it currently returns to default afterwards.",4
Gregorius Royan,"like the new update, which can change the color of the chat bubble to various colors. but there is a weakness if changed to another color, the blue tick color changes to white. even though the blue mark is a special feature that indicates that the message has been read so far. please so that this special feature can be returned in the next update.",4
Johann Reyneke,"A week ago WhatsApp started to delay getting images to the ""to send"" screen (screen is black for 43 seconds).

Fred Asare,"D app is great, which has made communication easier n flexible. SUGGESTION I've lost great number of information sent or received, because restoring backups failed. Please I'll suggest that, though encrypted, messages should be saved under or with email addresses instead of phone numbers.

In this way, no info will be lost whether new or old",4
Bello Adura,"Without this app I'm not sure some things will be easy to do, it has been a major tool on everyone's mobile phone But I wish you can add a feature, which we can invite someone (contact) into a group just for a period of time and there will be some certain things the person (contact) can do.

† Des Clowniac.†,"Please undo the update you did to share photos from gallery, it sucks, it doesn't show all archives/albums. You have to open camera, enter on the pic icon to just be able to see all of your albums and select a pic, otherway, if you open the normal pic icon that appears when you touch the ""clip"" icon, it shows less albums, and by defect, you have to search manually the image you're looking for, also, this update looks awful :( please undo it to the old one and keep it that way.",1
Silver Wings,"Well, all i can say is the app works perfectly as intended. It's still the best messaging app until now with how useful and simple it is. But... 😅 there is one problem that i have is that when you go to a group's media links and docs section there is a single problem which is you can't search for the files you want without the app crashing :/ this problem has been there for a while now and i'd love if it gets fixed as it helps people look for what they want quicker. Thank you!",5
Desmond Kettledas,"Greatest app ever. Millions use it everyday. The app is a social media app but thousands use it for business purposes also. It fast , reliable and to crown it all is that you can send videos too. News , social media, traffic reports, functions, and you can connect to people abroad. No hassle no fuzz . Just about anything is possible and it's AI functions are really good.",5
Onkel Bo,"Since the last update I can't correct written words anymore. It always selects the whole word but doesn't show any option (like copy, select all,...). Because of this I'm not able to go in between words to correct single mistyped letters or insert a word to a sentence without replacing/re-writing the previous word in the message. Now I have to write my messages in a text editor to then copy them to WA and thats really not nice.",2
Onur Demir,"The UX has worsened dramatically. It used to works smoothly for sharing pictures/files/gifs etc. Missing key features: -Multiple forwarded images don't keep the descriptions -It is not possible to edit the text before sending a gif -Uploading an image became very difficult, the image attachement item doesn't bring you to your gallery but a few albums. The overall experience quality dropped significantly, please bring back the UX of a couple of previous version ago.",1
Joshua Abu,"The app has been very buggy since morning, I updated the app few days ago. I have been struggling to navigate and type messages, the app will just lag then I would have to close the app. I was starting to think it was my phone but every other application works fine and smooth. Please optimize your application for android 14. It is very buggy.",2
jagadish more,"I have noticed an issue with the sorting of recently updated statuses in my contact list. Previously, the statuses that were most recently updated used to appear at the top of the list. However, after a recent update, I am seeing these statuses appear randomly or at the bottom, which makes it difficult to view the latest updates quickly. This change has disrupted the ease of accessing new updates, and I believe it may be a bug or an unintended change in functionality. Kindly check..",1
Shehanshah Baloch,"Hello WhatsApp Team, I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share a suggestion to enhance the video sharing experience on WhatsApp. I think it would be incredibly useful to add a ""Crop"" feature and variable speed options (e.g., 1x, 1.5x, 2x, etc.) for videos uploaded to WhatsApp Status. This would give users more flexibility and creativity when sharing videos. Thank you for considering my suggestion! I look forward to seeing future updates.",5

Chanuri Kumara,"I just ""upgraded"" to the new avatar to see what it was like, but I didn't know I couldn't go back to the original design! I wouldn't have done it if I knew, because now it looks absolutely horrible! The old avatar had a more cartoonish look and feel to it, not to mention a sweetness that was really nice. This new one looks so realistic and grown-up, none of the dramatic expressions work well with it. I'm so disappointed, I'm going to delete it altogether. Please bring back the old design!",4
Joe W,"Can't transfer to new phone. Backed up daily on old phone but now have lost all chats. What's the point in having all this fancy back up and storage if you can't even transfer to a new phone?

Pls fix this in next update. Thanks !",4
Victoria,"Editing a message has become so annoying. For example, if I want to capitalize a letter in a word I've already typed, I used to be able to just tap before the letter, delete it, and retype the capitalized version. But now, thanks to WhatsApp's update, it forces me to select the entire word/phrase. That means I have to delete the whole thing and retype it just to change one letter. Why make something simple so complicated!?",1
Md.Kamrul Hasan,"WhatsApp is an excellent communication platform offering a user-friendly interface for messaging, voice, and video calls.

I was just unable to move my chats and no active data. due to the sensitivity of the data I required it back.

To say how deeply dissapointed I am to not have any messages from the support team is an understatement. I've got my chat, no thanks to you!",1

Ian Seale,"Messed up after last update. Previously, when in a Chat, could attach a Photo from a Folder in my Phone Gallery. Now, it doesn't present Gallery, justbspme random folders, and offers Cloud Media Storage as an option. Within Whatsapp cannot see my Phone Gallery or theFolders and Photos/Videos within it. Its exactly the same on my wife's phone. I've tried reporting it, but all there is, is an AI bot which is completely useless and cannot help. Please revert the update until you can fix this one.",1

ASAD ULLAH SHAH BUKHARI,"Group calls are a big issue when you don't lock the screen from the power button; the sensor doesn't always put the screen off, and group calling starts without you realizing it. Especially older people prefer simpler platforms, as they always face unwanted group calls that happen when the screen is on and their face touches it randomly. The group call option needs a protective layer or a better upgrade.",1
Rachel B,HATE the new update and format. It's shambolic. I can't send pictures anymore as I can't access albums to attach them. Just trying to send a picture now is irritating and adding text is a nightmare too. This is enough to make me get rid of WhatsApp and use a different service. It's been absolutely ruined. Miss notifications all the time. And it takes forever to send videos and pics. I've used WhatsApp for over a decade and it's awful now.,1
Shiven Maharaj,"The best messenger by far! But if you guys could add the ability to pin our favorite emoticons that would make the user experience SO much better 🙂 recent emoticons constantly loose what I wanna use and the order always changes.

Keep perfecting!!",5
muhamad jamhuri,"Thank you to WA who continue to develop the WA application, I want to ask about a finding that I think is a bit of a hindrance to daily work, namely when we activate the privacy settings for rejecting messages from unknown numbers, it causes problems with the link to the laptop, but if the setting is turned off, then linking WA to web.whatsapp runs smoothly without any problems, please WA investigate whether this finding is true",5

İbrahim Ulvi Mercan,"My problem is about whatsapp voice note playing. When a voice note is playing, you can't touch the screen, especially the above half. If you touch the screen, the speaker changes and screen closes.

GalaxyMaker,"new updates are very annoying like all the other reviews say. When trying to send a photo, instead of the albums showing first, ""recents"" do and it takes longer to send a pic. Also the worst thing about trying to send single or multiple photos to people is the selector, when you scroll down it's fine, but when you scroll back up (to say select another you missed) it ALWAYS swipes the photo selector off and every photo you have selected has gone and you have to reopen and re-select the photos!!",1

Just do it in one click. So their messages come through. You just don't get a notification or a sound. Maybe there should also be another option where you can decide if people can see if you're on WhatsApp or not. Other than that it's quite good.",5
E P,No Notifications on S24 Ultra. I'm so annoyed. This app worked great for years on iphone. After switching to a Samsung I realized it's the only app where notifications don't come up on the lock screen regardless of settings. Regardless of whether it's locked or unlocked. Very very frustrating. I have to tap my screen every time and then it only shows the tiny little whatsapp icon/bubble but not the actual messages. No idea when notifications are coming in or not.,2
Paula Rakowska,"The app logged me out randomly. After I logged back in, the app never recovered some messages and multimedia, so I lost them. This is very disappointing, unacceptable 😡 I tried contacting the support, they sent irrelevant answers, and the chat us an automatic bot, which does not provide any help. What a catastrophe.",1
Adam Toynton,HELP! Your app has really helped me stay in touch with my Mum and we share photos and messages every day. HOWEVER over the last few weeks when I write a message and attach a photograph only the photo is sent and the message disappears. It's a really frustrating little hiccup with the app and hope someone at WhatsApp is able to have a look at it as a Reddit forum shows that a lot of people are suffering from the same issue irrespective of whether they use an Android or Apple fone.,4
Raymond Wachaga,"Consider adding a reading bookmark feature in group chats. Some groups are really active and staying up to date in a single session can be a daunting task. Unfortunately the moment you open the group chat and read through a couple of messages then navigate out to another chat, all the messages you did not read are marked as read and you have to scroll back all the way up to where you left of, hoping something will look familiar.",4
ADIKWO NATHAN,"WhatsApp is a fantastic messaging app that combines simplicity with powerful features. It's perfect for staying connected with friends, family, and colleagues through texts, calls, and video chats. The end-to-end encryption ensures privacy, and features like group chats, status updates, and file sharing make communication seamless. Highly recommended!",4
bella,"There is a problem Ever since I updated the app, anytime I want to send a video to someone or my status.. there is always some extra minutes to the video. The exact place that the video is meant to end will then freeze meanwhile the other minutes of the video will keep playing. But the video will still be frozen. Please Whatsapp should do something about this.",3
David Moreira,"Forces you to give access to contacts so they can mine your data. Without it you can't backup, and easy to lose all of your chats and history due to error prone workload to transfer data to a new phone. For example if you log in ti WhatsApp on a new phone it will log you out of your original phone and ALL your chats are gone/inaccessible henceforth. If you accidentally uninstall WhatsApp on your phone, ALL your data is gone/inaccessible after you reinstall it since you don't have a backup.",1
Sausha,"I really like what's app and it's features. It easy to use, has encrypted messages, and allows you to use less data for calls. Plus you can video chat, attach files, call and delete your messages for both you and the other person if you make a mistake",4
Jason Sheffield,"👏Meta for including AI in this application. This essential app is known for its diverse, multimedia-rich formats and its immediate direct one-on-one and group chats. Users confidently use it knowing that messages are end-to-end encrypted keeping them private 👌. I suggest that new users be aware of the media-sharing. You can end up with everyone else's images from groups added to your own. Hopefully, in future updates, there will be enhanced ⚠️ warnings before confirming this option.",5
Md Samshe,"This is the best messaging app with top-notch security and seamless performance. It offers fast messaging, high-quality voice/video calls, and end-to-end encryption for privacy.

Rahul Barwar,"#videocall Use-Friendly Interface: WhatsApp’s interface is clean, simple, and easy to navigate, making it accessible for users of all ages. Group Chats: The app supports group messaging, making it easy to stay connected with family, friends, or colleagues. Groups can support up to 256 members. End-to-End Encryption: WhatsApp encrypts messages end-to-end, meaning no one, including WhatsApp itself, can read your messages.",5
Gabriel,"Whatsapp wants to have a gallery of its own instead of relying on the system but can't do the job done in the slightest. Who even greenlit this. Why did you first hide the gallery button, then now remove it altogether. I gave permission to full access and yet it only sees four folders. What do you think am I gonna do with a ""cloud media app"" button? I can't send photos to people! Also it's 2025, let us crop videos in the editor, the technology is there.",1
mukthaar goolam,"It works perfectly fine but since this month, I experienced that if I don't go into the application, no messages show on the notification panel. Second issue I have is when I read a message after going into the application the notification panel still shows the notifications, so I need to manually swipe notifications on the panel after they are read and responded to. Last issue when you double click someone's profile picture it opens either previous conversation or locked chats folder.",3

The song when add will compressed like you compress the file for send a message, so size not oversize for app. Thankyou for making this app.",5

Dambo Sam,I don't know why my account keeps logging out from time to time. Next thing is to request for review. This particular issue also persisted with my other account until whatsapp couldn't register it again. I have pleaded for a permanent solution each time I am logged out all to no avail. I want to believe there are no humans reading our complaints or addressing issues. They are just programed.,2
anilkumar muraleedharan,"I’ve been a long-time user of WhatsApp, but the latest update has been incredibly frustrating. The app has not responded every time I try to use it, making it nearly impossible to send messages or access my chats.

A timely fix would restore my confidence in the app. Until then, I’m left disap",1
Vivian Nkiruka Nwosu,"The app is very good and functional but I think it can do better, like in group or normal chats you can't return to the same chat you left when you didn't finish reading the rest it just takes you the bottom of the chat this same feature is available in the iOS version of WhatsApp. Their is a bug in the status, when new media get uploaded they don't do so in the time they were uploaded and so they appear at random. Please fix all this issues.",3
PRASHANT (PRASHANT CHOUDHARY),"""I'm extremely disappointed with WhatsApp's handling of user privacy and chat backups. Despite regularly backing up my chats, I recently lost all my conversations due to a so-called technical issue. When I tried to restore my chats, the app displayed an error message saying 'Something went wrong.' This experience has made me realize that WhatsApp doesn't prioritize user data protection and backup security. It's unacceptable. So please be careful.",1
Adarsh Adarsh,"WhatsApp is great. I have a SUGGESTION : Suggestion is, There is no option to add music in the status. We cannot add a music to our picture or videos in the status options. After adding the music options in WhatsApp status, it would be more great and amazing experiences for everyone. Please consider this as a common interest and, Kindly do the needful..",5
Efosa Ebuehi,"Okay... The regular updates are nice—something new every once in a while. But, some old features that were quite useful suddenly get phased out and that leaves users frustrated. For example, is it just me or is the emoji button on text-style status update suddenly gone? And this stock keyboard on my Android just doesn't have all the WhatsApp emojis I like to use. Please, for the love of humanity, bring the emoji button back on the text-style status updates. Bring it back now!",3
Sarathy Satagopan,"Dear WhatsApp Team, as an introvert, the Status feature has been my go-to for starting conversations. But the new 'like button' 💚 has made it harder to connect. People just 'like' the status and move on, leaving no opportunity for meaningful chats. It's like a door closes before it even opens! Please consider giving users an option to disable the like button to encourage actual replies. Help us introverts keep conversations alive!",2
Nic K,new update of sharing images with contacts sucks. message you write that is attached to he image is erased if you minimise the app and reopen it. if you want to edit what you have written it starts highlighting the text wherever you click. erases the entire attachment if you scroll down by mistake. Why would they make this update. ☠️ Classic Meta,1
Hussaina Afrin,I am so disappointed with this app as it automatically deleting my pictures and videos downloaded from whatsapp from my gallery. I keep changing the settings and it still occurs to happen over and over again and at times I do not realise that the media is being deleted. Finally it's at the cost of my beautiful memories to that is being deleted because of this app. Very dissatisfied.,1
Anisha Menon,"I find the most recent WhatsApp update to be really annoying. The status update is now arranged horizontally instead of vertically as it was before. Please keep it easy to use and prioritise privacy, which is severely lacking. Spammers have begun contacting us without any requests, and if this keeps active you will soon lose users. I hope you see this and take appropriate action.",1
Marcus Wong,"The app is fantastic and packed with useful features. However, since the recent updates, my earbuds have been stopping music playback while I’m texting.

Inganathi Dlamini,"It's a good app but i think all these new updates are just unnecessary and a bit much for a massaging app i feel likes there is too much going on , I was still adjusting to the fact that the statuses are suddenly horizontal then the layout of the statuses changes again? It feels and looks like Facebook, I just like the way it was before. It's just too much now",3
Laure B.,"awful update than when you type text and go to add a picture, if you close/reduce it or open it fully wrong, your text has been deleted. choose picture or file THEN add text, or copy, else it will be discarded no warning just plain awful, absolutely unecessary update the ""half open"" way the gallery open. why? so confusion and then it deletes your message??? is that a bug or just awful design?",1
AJ's Marvel,I'm unable to open my WhatsApp account. It's always showing whatsapp keeps stopping. Please do something.

I didn't expect this kind of service from whatsapp. Till now there is no proper solution.,1
Elizabeth Biernacki,Voice calls and video calls are 100% audible and clear. Messaging is smoother with the new feature where you can see when someone is typing below the last message. It made waiting for their reply more enjoyable and less uninteresting. The new feature that allows you to like someone's status makes communication a lot easier.,5
Rahul Shelar,"Hey whatsapp, you should add an option to silent the incoming video calls, just like we do with normal calls, by pressing volume key it goes on silent. unlike whatsapp video calls, it's so embarassing/ irritating sometimes if one gets a video calls in a public environment like office, library, college and the person don't have any option to put it on silent at that moment it feels so helpless and embarassing. btw I didn't expected WhatsApp would miss out on such a basic feature.",3
Benefit Onyeka,"I'm giving it a three because of my dissatisfaction with it's latest update feature, the voice note transcripts.

Surely they must have been able to fix it in that time. The answer is they can't want to fix it. I don't know why, maybe some way of forcing you to upload everything about you and your friends to their server. If they wanted to fix this they could, would have done it years ago. They are NEVER going to fix this.",1

Itohan Asemota,"Please work on your status mentions. Each time I tap on the @ symbol, no contact or group shows. It just keeps rolling like it's loading for a very long time. I've updated my WhatsApp version thinking it's probably because I didn't update it, but it's still the same. My phone's android by the way. Thank you!",3
Kelly Grace,"Meta, stop making the fonts of usernames smaller. It looks terrible. First it was instagram, then whatsapp. it looks hideous, just bring back the username having a big font and leave it be. These updates are just unnecessary. Focus on necessary updates such as the file button thats was recently added on the status section working and navigating to your gallery.",4
Thor Zammer,"Great app except..... Suddenly I can't access my albums to add photos to my status! I have to go to camera, then photos, then gallery!! Crazy. Lots of people have this problem now. Also, I use copy all the time, but bookmarks or pins rarely. Why is copy in a menu now?! Crazy! Also, the scrollbar in a convo is so tiny, I literally cannot use it! Also crazy! Do devs never use this app themselves?",2
Abdullahi Sulaiman,"Not bad, but two issues, when viewing media on a chat, it combines all the media files whether sent or received, I feel it should be separated, also the status upload is terrible, it allows you write more than it can contain and when u upload it, you see half of what u have written is not there, also video trim for status is not good, u can trim 30seconds out of a 1 minute video and it will upload a different 30 secs from what u selected. Lastly you should select what u want as the app lock",5
Gryd CG “Toby”,"Okay recently there has been a lot of bugs in the app like glitches and statuses are transparent behind them, but the most annoying is when I'm on a call and I leave the app, and then my mic stops working... Like the green dot to signify that the mic is being used disappears. It also happens when my screen turns off",1
ovana kanyanda,"Absolutely hate the new way of selecting photos. The old way was much better and easier to use. The current one is just so tedious. Please bring that way back or at least make it so that this ""New"" way makes it easier to access all the folders with pictures/videos on the phone. Imagine having to go to my gallery every time I need to send something to someone whilst in chat.",1
Rita Ododo,"it's indeed an amazing app. Literally the only social media I'm always active on but unfortunately, I have a problem with the updated version. Normally, when I'm about to post a write up, I make use of WhatsApp emojis rather than the ones that come with my keyboard but now, that feature has been omited. I can only use the WhatsApp emojis when I want to post a video or picture but not write ups. Please, I'd love for this to be rectified.",3
Lee,"Poor privacy. Run by Meta. Unencrypted chat backups. Video call quality is often atrocious and unreliable. Selfies automatically mirror, which is annoying. Blocking someone doesn't hide their icon, name and/or messages in group chats, which is very annoying (other apps manage this just fine). Eventually, WhatsApp will be replaced.",2
Osaloni Anuoluwapo,"I was using a phone number before I started seeing changes like 'I can't open my account on whatsapp'. Thought it was network until I had to fill in a review and the app came up running again. But it happened for like a few weeks. Became frustrated and decided to register a new SIM and the same problem still continued. Now, I can't even register any of the two phone numbers as none can let me register on this app. Pls I would like a suggestion or an advice on what to do.",1
Bueno Cisar,"Ok so here's the scenario by order of the sequence it happened My phone's screen got broken and I chose changing the phone over fixing it's screen, thought for a while about not being able to backup my chats before doing so. I had linked to my laptop, but I found out back up can only be done through the main device. At last, I thought I should give up on past experiences and try to earn new ones, I gave up on my beloved chats but I would recommend adding back up feature through linked devices.^^",4
Steven Ikenna,"This update is nothing to write home about....before you can be able to send pictures to someone or put in your status update it takes a while. I thought it was from my phone then I formatted my phone losing most of my documents only to come find out that's from this latest WhatsApp update. You can't even send the app to another, keeps writing WhatsApp has stopped unlike the previous update. I just don't like this update, it's really annoying!",1
Bishop David Sanda,I will love to see three features added 1. The ability to schedule messages (eg ahead of someone's birthday). 2. Ability to edit status in case of an error. 3. There seem to be a bug in the search feature. It works a little and then it stops until the app is restarted. Thanks. I am so loving this app.,5
reuben syer,"Whatsapp on Honor x6a saves audios to /whatsapp (the old location that was used before android 11) and not /com.whatsapp which means it doesnt show up on my music player app and I have to move every single audio that I want to send to people etc to a new com/whatsapp folder that I created every time, or I have to forward the music file to myself on gmail to download it to easily use it normally... PLEASE. I'm out of hope and this is so inefficient.",2
Prem Sagar,"WhatsApp in my samsug galaxy M35 looks completely different from other galaxy devices. Especially status feed looks totally different. In other galaxy M35 devices status comes in "" horizontally "" but in my phone its vertical. The functionality of this app in my phone is also very different why? I dont know. Please respond this issue as soon as possible.",3
Life with Annie,"the process of switching phones is 🐄 💩 on this app. If I've already backed up my messages, why do I need to scan a QR code on my old phone to get them? Have lost so many messages because of this feature. Should just automatically have all previous messages even when logging in from a new device without having to back it all up or scan stuff! now I can't even log in on my old phone to QR code transfer it. Please get in touch with me to fix this ASAP!!",2
Caspar Groeneveld,"WhatsApp is the only provider of an essential service that offers no mechanism to retrieve your data and continue usage if you lose access. When you lost access to your number and you reset or lose your phone, you lose years of your history. It's not just bad user service, it's bad business and makes it vulnerable to an alternative messaging system that does allow you to retrieve your own data.",1
Chioma,"WhatsApp Messenger is the best messenger I know, but it's lacking a very essential feature, ""voice message preview."" This feature will allow users to listen to listen to their voice messages before sending. Voice messages should have at least MP3 and wav formats. It should also have HD, HD +, UHD, and UHD + qualities. A new feature needs to be added, the ""Easy Scroll up"" button. This button will scroll you up to the first message in that chat, just like there is an easy ""scroll-down button.""",4
Arga Satya Prawira,"For the past few months, chat notifications and ringtone wouldn't appear on my phone... Making replying to messages be extremely delayed because I wouldn't know if someone texted me until I actually open the app. I thought something's wrong with my phone or settings but i checked and there's nothing wrong with my phone or settings. I also asked others about this and they said they're experiencing the same thing... Please fix this!",1
Itz_ Phoenix,"Wish I could give a half at this point. Delete ur wp and you'll know how annoying it is to try and log in again. It's disappointing at this point. It's saying that it has send a code to the wp that's logged into another device (mine) but it isn't actually, I deleted it somehow and now I'm trying to log in... This is what's happening, ridiculous.",1
Alaa Buhussaien,"Hello, There is big bug with the chat themes in WhatsApp app (Android version only), The 🎤 microphone color not changed When you changed the themes colors. When the ""Read receipts"" is ON/enabled. The microphone icon should be not white before listening to voice messages (should be silver then white after listening) In WA on iOS not having this bug (Only on Android) white always (even when read receipts on or off) in both white. This should be fixed when it's on. Please fix this bug on Android.",2
Yatish Balaji Motamarri,"Great App. But waiting for a feature from many years. The sequence in which we copy a message and the sequence in which it get send when we try to forward should be same. It actually pics some random sequence. And images videos too are sent later which then looses context of the text messages in between media Feature request: Delete last N days in chat. When u reply to ur written msg X, and then u edit the prev msg X, the preview doesnt change.",1
Sumera Iqbal,"Very bad experience with transferring my old chat to new phone. Here are the number of things I've tried but nothing worked as of yet: 1. Backup through email: I have my backup on my Google drive but new whatsapp doesn't give an option to me to restore it directly from Google Drive 2. Via old phone: I have tried to transfer chats and images, but it doesn't connect my new Samsung phone with my old oppo phone. 3. While switching phones, it locks me for 1 day. Please fix it ASAP. Make it simpler.",1
RAJESH BIRJE,"Positive Feedback: Easy to use with a wide user base. Free, high-quality voice and video calls. Strong privacy features (end-to-end encryption). Versatile with text, media sharing, and group chats. Accessible across platforms. Negative Feedback: Requires phone number, limiting use. Frequent updates can confuse users. Media-heavy chats consume storage. Limited customization options. Overwhelming group notifications and business spam.",5
Mxbert,"The biggest issue I have with the app is that no matter how many settings I turn off within the app or settings on my own phone, it refuses to stop downloading pictures and gifs to my phone; Meaning I'd have to manually delete them after just wanting to look at a picture/gif. No support methods helped either, official or unofficial.",3
György László,"What a garbage application...I'm guessing since the last update it keeps logging me out after a few hours from Whatsapp Web that I am running on Chrome without even giving a heads up...I had one ticket I created for another issue almost a year ago and support is still ""working on it"". Was a great app, used it for years without any issue - must have hired a bunch of talentless hacks recently...",1
Raebekka Ann,Great app almost only social communication app I use doesn't disappoint. One thing I find aggravating tho and wish would be changed - when I add people to the archived folder I don't wish to see notifications even if small in the corner - wish there was a way to mute even that to the option of keeping the folders separate no notification seen unless you open the archived folder. 🙈,5
fâìsäl Sîddìqûī,Dear WhatsApp Team I hope this message finds you well. I would like to bring to your attention a suggestion for improving the platform's functionality. It would be highly beneficial if the AI-generated messages or individual parts of a conversation could be copied separately. This feature would make it much easier and more convenient for users to extract specific information from chats without having to copy the entire message.,3
Alistair Leeson,"I have recently bought a Samsung S25 and cannot download WhatsApp at all ... let alone transfer data from an old phone (S8) ... I cannot get passed the Initialised section after entering name ... 'Unable to connect - try again later' (uninstalled countless times, cleared cache/data from app and Google store') without success. Useless - no fixes, no solutions online - any help would be welcomed - currently using on an old S8.",1
Sourav Hasan,"WhatsApp has a serious issue where calls go mute(Pixel device) when switching apps or locking the screen on Android 15. This makes it nearly impossible to use for multitasking or long calls. Despite granting all permissions and disabling battery optimizations, the problem persists. It's disappointing that such a basic functionality is broken on a leading app. Fix this immediately!""",1
christopher auger,"V. Good. Needs notification sound option with word ,one which cannot be ignored.once I have granted all permissions I'm told to remove permissions to free up space. Needs method option for reading messages. I would like option to record my calls.camera should have spot metering. Sometimes difficult to select copy and paste messages. S10plus.",4
Manish Sihag,"Dear WhatsApp Team, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide feedback on your recent update. While I appreciate the efforts to enhance the user experience, I have a suggestion regarding the ""All"" tab in lists. Currently, the ""All"" tab sticks to the top, which can be inconvenient for users who prefer to prioritize other tabs. I think it would be more user-friendly if the ""All"" tab didn't stick, allowing users to choose which tabs they want to prioritize. Thank you for consider",4
Johan Pottas,I use WhatsApp for a long time but when I want to share a good night picture then it shows me recents with a down arrow then if u press the arrow only a few photo folders show. They have taken away gallery then it was fixed back to normal for 9 weeks and it changed back to the same thing again. Now gallery is missing again. No I don't like it how the sharing of media is now. Otherwise WhatsApp is perfect and no other complains.,4
Janardhan Buchupati,"WhatsApp Messenger is a great app with all the features I need to stay connected. My only suggestion for improvement would be the option for a true black background instead of the current dark grey.  A pure black theme would not only look more sleek, but it would also make a noticeable difference in battery consumption, especially on devices with AMOLED screens.  This is a feature many users are requesting and I hope to see it implemented soon.",3
