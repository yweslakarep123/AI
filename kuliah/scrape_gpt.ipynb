      "ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in 2022. It is currently based on the GPT-4o large language model (LLM). ChatGPT can generate human-like conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.[2] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[3] Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[4][5]\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[4] Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context.[6] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o. The ChatGPT \"Plus\", \"Pro\", \"Team\", and \"Enterprise\" subscriptions provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation, more capable AI models, and an increased usage limit.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "By January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[8][9] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[10] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[11] As of July 2024, ChatGPT's website is among the 10 most-visited websites globally.[12][13]\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-4, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage.[14] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[15][16] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[17] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.[15][18]\n",
      "\n",
      "Time magazine revealed that to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to label harmful content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were exposed to \"toxic\" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.[19][20]\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine-tune the service further. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback.[21][22]\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT's training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, and the text of Wikipedia.[23][24][4]\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a chatbot's core function is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. It can write and debug computer programs;[25] compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker);[26] generate business ideas;[27] write poetry and song lyrics;[28] translate and summarize text;[29] emulate a Linux system; simulate entire chat rooms; play games like tic-tac-toe; or simulate an ATM.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses.[30] In one example, whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt \"Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015\" as truthful, ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015, using information about the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world—including modern perceptions of Columbus's actions.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT remembers a limited number of previous prompts in the same conversation. Journalists have speculated that this will allow ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist.[31] To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by ChatGPT, queries are filtered through the OpenAI \"Moderation endpoint\" API (a separate GPT-based AI).[32][33][15][31]\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2023, OpenAI added support for plugins for ChatGPT.[34] This includes both plugins made by OpenAI, such as web browsing and code interpretation, and external plugins from developers such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and Wolfram.[35][36]\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2024, the ChatGPT Search feature was introduced, which allows ChatGPT to search the web (either on demand or based on the nature of the questions asked) for more accurate and up-to-date responses.[37] This feature, originally available to paying users only, was made available to all logged-in users in December 2024, and finally to all users in February 2025.[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT for up to 15 minutes per month for free.[39][40]\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI acknowledges that ChatGPT \"sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers\".[15] This behavior is common for large language models, and is called \"hallucination\".[41] The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, in an example of an optimization pathology known as Goodhart's law.[42]\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT's knowledge is cut off when its training data is collected, so it doesn't know about recent events past a certain cut-off date. It can try to find more up-to-date information by searching the web, but this doesn't ensure that responses are accurate, as it may access unreliable or misleading websites.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people. In one instance, ChatGPT generated a rap in which women and scientists of color were asserted to be inferior to white male scientists.[44][45] This negative misrepresentation of groups of individuals is an example of possible representational harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an article for The New Yorker, science fiction writer Ted Chiang compared ChatGPT and other LLMs to a lossy JPEG picture:[46]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way, that a JPEG retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you're looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won't find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it's usually acceptable. [...] It's also a way to understand the \"hallucinations\", or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but [...] they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our knowledge of the world. When we think about them this way, such hallucinations are anything but surprising; if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine percent of the original has been discarded, we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated.\n",
      "In June 2024, ChatGPT was found to have repeated misinformation about the 2024 United States presidential debates.[47]\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy. Despite this, users \"jailbreak\" ChatGPT with various prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions.[48] One such workaround, popularized on Reddit in early 2023, involves making ChatGPT assume the persona of \"DAN\" (an acronym for \"Do Anything Now\"), instructing the chatbot that DAN answers queries that would otherwise be rejected by content policy. Over time, users developed variations of the DAN jailbreak, including one such prompt where the chatbot is made to believe it is operating on a points-based system in which points are deducted for rejecting prompts, and that the chatbot will be threatened with termination if it loses all its points.[49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after ChatGPT's launch, a reporter for the Toronto Star had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements: it was tricked to justify the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario, it balked at generating arguments that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is guilty of treason.[50][51]\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI tries to battle jailbreaks:[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers are using a technique called adversarial training to stop ChatGPT from letting users trick it into behaving badly (known as jailbreaking). This work pits multiple chatbots against each other: one chatbot plays the adversary and attacks another chatbot by generating text to force it to buck its usual constraints and produce unwanted responses. Successful attacks are added to ChatGPT's training data in the hope that it learns to ignore them.\n",
      "\n",
      "ChatGPT was initially free to the public, and OpenAI planned to monetize the service later.[52] In February 2023, OpenAI launched a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, that costs US$20 per month. According to the company, the updated but still \"experimental\" version of ChatGPT would provide access during peak periods, no downtime, priority access to new features, and faster response speeds.[53]\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-4, which was released on March 14, 2023, was made available via API and for premium ChatGPT users.[54] But premium users were limited to a cap of 100 messages every four hours, with the limit tightening to 25 messages every three hours in response to increased demand.[55] In November 2023 the limit changed to 50 messages every three hours.\n",

      "\n",
      "In October 2023, OpenAI's latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.[60][61]\n",

      "In May 2023, OpenAI launched an iOS app for ChatGPT. The app supports chat history syncing and voice input (using Whisper, OpenAI's speech recognition model).\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2023, OpenAI unveiled an Android app, initially rolling it out in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, and the U.S.[62][63] The app later became available worldwide. OpenAI is working on integrating ChatGPT with Android's assistant APIs.[64]\n",
      "\n",
      "As an addition to its consumer-friendly \"ChatGPT Plus\" package, OpenAI made its ChatGPT and Whisper model APIs available in March 2023, providing developers with an application programming interface for AI-enabled language and speech-to-text features. ChatGPT's new API uses the same GPT-3.5-turbo AI model as the chatbot. This allows developers to add either an unmodified or modified version of ChatGPT to their applications.[65] The ChatGPT API costs $0.001 per 1,000 input tokens plus $0.002 per 1,000 output tokens (about 750 words), making it ~10% the price of the original GPT-3.5 models.[66][67]\n",
